After all, a monster with a high Might should be harder to knock prone most of the time than a creature lacking in that characteristic.</p><p>Ability effects that have a <strong>potency</strong> are applied to a target only if the effect’s potency value is higher than the target’s indicated characteristic score. The characteristic a target uses to resist a potency is based on the ability used, while the value of the potency for your hero’s abilities is based on one of your characteristics and determined by your class.</p><p>Your character has a <strong>weak</strong>, an <strong>average</strong>, and a <strong>strong</strong> potency value, as follows:</p><ul><li>Your weak potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 2.</li><li>Your average potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 1.</li><li>Your strong potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score.</li></ul><p>In abilities and other effects, a potency always appears as the single-letter abbreviation for the target’s characteristic: <span class=\"potency-char\">M</span> for Might, <span class=\"potency-char\">A</span> for Agility, <span class=\"potency-char\">R</span> for Reason, <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> for Intuition, or <span class=\"potency-char\">P</span> for Presence. That characteristic is followed by a “less than” sign (&lt;) and your potency value—for example, <span class=\"potency-char\">M&lt;w</span> or <span class=\"potency-char\">R&lt;v</span> —with the value indicating the minimum score in that characteristic that the target needs to beat the effect.</p><p>As an example, consider the conduit’s Judgment’s Hammer ability, which has the following power roll:</p><p class=\"ability-power-potency\">Power Roll + Intuition:</p><dl class=\"power-roll-display\"><dt class=\"tier1\"><p>!</p></dt><dd><p>3 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;w</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier2\"><p>@</p></dt><dd><p>6 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;v</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier3\"><p>#</p></dt><dd><p>9 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;s</span> , prone and can’t stand (save ends)</p></dd></dl><p>At 1st level, a conduit uses their Intuition score to determine their potency values, and that score is 2. That gives the conduit the following potencies:</p><ul><li>Weak: 0</li><li>Average: 1</li><li>Strong: 2</li></ul><p>When writing Judgment’s Hammer on their character sheet, the conduit’s player updates the damage and converts the weak, average, and strong potencies into their numerical values, knowing that those values won’t change until the character hits 2nd echelon and their Intuition score becomes 3. That produces the following:</p><p class=\"ability-power-potency\">Power Roll + Intuition:</p><dl class=\"power-roll-display\"><dt class=\"tier1\"><p>!</p></dt><dd><p>5 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;0</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier2\"><p>@</p></dt><dd><p>8 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;1</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier3\"><p>#</p></dt><dd><p>11 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">A&lt;2</span> , prone and can’t stand (save ends)</p></dd></dl><p>During a game session, the conduit uses Judgment’s Hammer to target a bandit with an Agility score of 0. The ability thus has the following outcomes at each tier:</p><ul><li>With a tier 1 outcome (11 or lower), the ability deals 5 holy damage to the bandit. But the bandit resists the additional effect because they have Agility 0 (and therefore don’t have an Agility of less than 0).</li><li>With a tier 2 outcome (12–16), the ability deals 8 holy damage. But the bandit is also knocked prone, unable to resist the additional effect because they would need an Agility of 1 or higher to do so. If the bandit had Agility 1 or higher, they would have taken 8 holy damage but stayed standing.</li><li>With a tier 3 outcome (17 or higher), the bandit takes 11 holy damage and is knocked flat and left struggling to stand, unable to resist the strong potency of the additional effect with a mere Agility 0.</li></ul><h4>Potency Presentation</h4><p>Potencies are presented in an abbreviated style in abilities so they don’t take up too much space, and so you can read them by saying: “If the target’s [characteristic] is less than [potency value], they [suffer effect].” If our 1st-level conduit obtained a tier 2 outcome when using Judgment’s Hammer, the player would say, “I deal 8 holy damage, and if the bandit’s Agility is less than 1, they fall prone.”</p><p>Reading the ability this way prevents a lot of back and forth. You don’t need to ask, “What’s the target’s Agility score?”, wait for a response, and then give the outcome. You can simply say, “If they don’t have an Agility of 1 or higher, they fall prone.” Players can let the Director figure out whether the target is prone and keep the game moving, with the Director doing the same in reverse when monsters and other foes use abilities with potencies against the heroes.</p><h4>Adjusting Potencies</h4><p>Potencies are made for quick resolution at the table, but a number of triggered actions and other abilities—for example, the censor’s Judgment ability and the null’s Null Field ability—allow you to manipulate the value of potencies. If you build a hero who can adjust potencies, pay attention during combat! You might be able to help out a friend who needs a little boost to make their ability take full effect, or hinder an enemy about to lock down one of your allies.</p><h4>Spending Resources on Potencies</h4><p>If an ability or feature allows you to spend your Heroic Resource on an effect that is entirely dependent on a potency and the target is unaffected because their characteristic is high enough to resist the potency, then you don’t spend the Heroic Resource.</p><p>For example, the tactician’s Overwatch ability allows the tactician to spend 1 focus to impose the slowed condition on a target who has <span class=\"potency-char\">R&lt;v</span>. Since spending focus this way has no other effect, if the tactician targets a creature whose high Reason leaves them unaffected, the tactician doesn’t waste any focus. However, if spending this focus had another automatic effect such as dealing extra damage to the target, the 1 focus would be spent even though the potency was resisted.</p><p>This rule also applies to Director-controlled creatures who spend Malice on abilities and features that affect a target using a potency and have no other automatic effects.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The Greatest City in This or Any Age! City of the Great Game! Located west across the Bale Sea from Vasloria, on the eastern coast of Rioja, Capital is not only the largest city in Orden—it’s the largest city there has ever been. Larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.</p><p>It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic where flying tapestries act as taxis, the reality of living in Capital is somewhat more mundane. Only the very wealthy can afford such luxuries.</p><p>The great houses, ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think vast wealth entitles them to rule. The great houses are very proud of their city. They believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, expect justice. They just don’t think anyone else should be able to <em>rule</em>.</p><p>The guilds, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, and largely obsessed with accruing wealth, city be damned. Three of them recently used their obscene wealth to buy great house status and now play the great game with the best of them.</p><p>The “great game” is espionage, and <strong>House Alvaro </strong>are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsor the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. While the greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the colleges in the university, which has historically doubled as the prince’s intelligence agency.</p><p><strong>House Vorona </strong>run the city’s navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy’s cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona’s Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing Capital has to a city-wide law enforcement organization. Each great house is expected to police its own district.</p><p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring that gives Vorona access to intelligence other factions can only dream of.</p><p><strong>House Navarr</strong>, oldest of the great houses, enforces the church’s law, which they call justice. Led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of the most powerful church in the city—the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless—House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and orders of knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.</p><p>Arguably the most powerful great house, <strong>House Valetta </strong>controls the Arbitros Fiat, the tax collectors. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore who, in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, opened the <em>Codex Mortis </em>and spoke the ritual which should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed every mortal in her district, including herself, into deathless revenants. Now, the Duchess Lenore is an immortal vampire queen. A dead lady, ruling over a dead city.</p><p>After the Lilac Night, when the prince was no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes they collected, Lady Shirome coordinated with two other guilds to buy Great House status for themselves.</p><p>Lady Shirome runs the city’s assayers guild, <strong>the Fulcrum</strong>. The guild controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was the Fulcrum that convinced the prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p><p>The Broadsheets, formally known as <strong>the Font</strong>, publish the thrice-daily news sheets everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in the city.</p><p>The Farrier’s Guild, popularly known as <strong>the Rasp</strong>, control transport throughout the city. Led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from Alloy who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the 13-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He created the <strong>Kites</strong>, couriers famous for getting a message anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. Kashimir’s monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives him enormous power, and he is not shy about seeking more.</p><p>Three years ago, the prince of Capital died leaving no heir or even a likely candidate. He was a young man, only forty-one, but the events surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and inaccurate accounts. Was he murdered like a commoner, or assassinated by a political rival? Evidence is scant, rumor substitutes as fact.</p><p>Now the great game takes on a new meaning as the four great houses and three newly ascendant guilds jockey for position, each wanting to step into the power vacuum left by the dead prince. Everyone knows a war is coming, a war of succession that means fighting on the street. But each player in the game would much prefer it if someone <em>else</em> made the first move.</p>"

The Director determines the exact nature of the consequence, which is typically related to the specific task.</p><p>For instance, if a hero suffers a consequence while trying to climb a wall, they might make it halfway up the wall and then fall, taking damage and landing prone. A hero trying to sneak by cultists might be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence strikes when a hero attempts to bribe a prison guard, the guard might decide to arrest the hero or lead them into a trap. If a hero suffers a consequence on a Reason test made to recall lore about the king’s favorite meal, they might confuse it for a dish to which the monarch is deathly allergic.</p><p>Not all consequences need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a hero might fail with a consequence on a test made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a noble. The failure means the cheating is noticed, but the Director decides that the noble doesn’t say anything. This consequence isn’t made apparent until later in the evening, when the noble has guards surround the hero, intent on taking the cheater down to the dungeon for stacking the deck.</p><p>Common consequences for failing a test include the following:</p><ul><li>Making an NPC so upset that they storm off, or betray, attack, or otherwise attempt to harm you</li><li>Drawing the attention of a group of foes</li><li>Triggering a trap or hazard that captures or significantly harms you or an ally</li><li>Breaking an important piece of equipment that is difficult to replace or repair</li><li>Thinking you know something that you don’t</li><li>Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved with a negotiation or a montage test you didn’t need to make before</li></ul><p>In lieu of other consequences, the Director also has the option to gain 2 additional Malice—a resource that creatures run by the Director use in combat—at the start of the next combat encounter.</p><hr /><h4>Success With a Consequence</h4><p>If you succeed on a test and incur a consequence, you do what you set out to do, but with an added cost. A hero might succeed in climbing up a wall, but the surface of the wall crumbles and becomes unstable as they do, making the climb more difficult for the ally ascending after them. When trying to sneak by a cultist, a hero successfully does so, but leaves footprints or other evidence of trespassing behind. If a hero bribes a guard to be allowed to sneak into a prison, the guard lets them in—but then demands a gemstone the hero needs for an important crafting project before they let the hero out.</p><p>Just like failure with a consequence, the consequences accompanying success don’t need to be immediately apparent. In lieu of other consequences, the Director has the option to gain 2 additional Malice at the start of the next combat encounter.</p><p>When a hero rolls a success with a consequence, the Director might give them a chance to fail instead. For instance, when a hero rolls a 10 on an easy Agility test to pick the lock on a chest, that’s a success with a consequence. The Director could suggest that the character has opened the lock but broken their lockpicks in the process (knowing the picks can’t be replaced until the hero returns to town), but can also give them the option of failing to pick the lock but keeping their lockpicks intact.</p>"

At 1st level, player characters are already known as heroes and have the power to save their local village. By the time the characters are 10th level, people all over the world—maybe even across all worlds—know the names of their saviors!</p><p>Since this game encompasses power levels from hometown heroes to demigods, the core experience has been divided into four different echelons. Each echelon determines the types of threats the heroes can take on, the stakes of their stories, and the rewards they receive at the various levels of play.</p><h3>1st Echelon (1st to 3rd Level)</h3><p>The 1st echelon of play details the stories of characters of 1st to 3rd level. At this echelon, the characters are local heroes. They save lost caravans, besieged villages, and overlooked neighborhoods within cities. Characters battle bands of mortal humanoids—dwarves, elves, goblins, humans, kobolds, orcs, and more. They can also face off against the occasional larger monstrous threat, such as a bredbeddle, ogre, or chimera. Such creatures can threaten a small community but rarely have plans for world domination or the destruction of the timescape. However, any of these adversaries might work for or be manipulated by stronger threats as a foreshadowing of what awaits the heroes at higher echelons.</p><h3>2nd Echelon (4th to 6th Level)</h3><p>The 2nd echelon of play covers 4th to 6th level. At this echelon, the heroes are now known throughout the wider region they serve. In Vasloria, this means the characters might save and be celebrated by an entire country. In Capital, their reputation and work could encompass several different neighborhoods of the enormous city. Heroes of the timescape might be known for saving a planet!</p><p>Heroes in this echelon battle humanoids of great supernatural power, such as draconians, devils, and hobgoblins. They face bosses possessed of cunning and ambition as great as their terrible influence, such as medusas and overminds. Heroes at this level also face the humanoid threats of earlier levels, but those foes are villainous counterparts of equal power rather than bands of ruffians or marauding armies.</p><h3>3rd Echelon (7th to 9th Level)</h3><p>The 3rd echelon of play covers 7th to 9th level. At this echelon, the heroes are saving and are known throughout the setting where they serve. Most folks in Vasloria, Capital, or across the larger timescape know of the heroes and are grateful for their efforts saving the continent, the entire city, or multiple worlds, respectively. Foes at this echelon include beings of great power such as giants, vampires, and valok.</p><h3>4th Echelon (10th Level)</h3><p>The 4th echelon of play explores the stories of characters of 10th level (and might even go beyond in future products). At this echelon, heroes are saving the entire timescape from threats such as liches, powerful dragons, and overlords like Ajax the Invincible.</p>"

In spite of this the people of Orden, regardless of ancestry, do not believe the gods control everything that happens in the world. They believe the gods created a natural world with its own cycles that are sometimes predictable, but which cannot be understood. It rained last Lyleth, and the Lyleth before that, so it’ll probably rain this Lyleth—but maybe not! And if not, that may be because the gods are displeased. But it might just as easily be because the gods are bored, or fickle or—even more likely, it has nothing to do with the gods, and there’s no way to know which.</p><p>When a river floods or crops fail, some people may curse the gods, but those people do not all believe a god caused these events. They may curse simply because the gods didn’t prevent catastrophe. They do not think, “Why did the gods do that?” They think, “Why did the gods make a world that behaves like this?”</p><p>The gods are powerful, but forbidden from acting directly upon or within the world. To enact their will, they use intermediaries—beings of demigod-like status, once mortals, who now serve their patron god in eternity. Many humans call these beings saints, while the other speaking peoples use the term heroes, or legendary heroes, not to be confused with the heroes you make using the character creation rules in this book.</p><p>Each god has many saints, some obscure. They sometimes manifest in the world. These encounters are always brief, leading sages and theologians to conclude there must be some limit to how much time or energy these saints and legendary heroes can spend on the prime manifold. Who created or enforces these limits?</p><p>No one knows.</p><p>As a result of this complex tapestry of belief and personalities, a farmer in Aendrim might call upon Adûn for strength while tilling the earth. But if a cool breeze suddenly came along, easing the bite of the sun on their back, they would almost certainly not thank Adûn or any of his saints. They would probably thank Saint Elspeth the Blithe, sometimes called the Summer Breeze. If they had a neighbor or relative with a shrine to Saint Elspeth in their home, they might give that person a small gift or offering and ask them to place it on their shrine. More likely, they would silently promise to do this, and then forget or get distracted.</p><p>If questioned about this—“Why did you call upon one god, but thank the saint of a completely different god?”—they would first be surprised by the question. It would not have occurred to them to examine this behavior. If pressed they would say, “Oh, I’m sure they worked it out between them.” They would not imagine, “Adûn told Viras, who told her saint, Elspeth, to send a cooling breeze,” but they would assume</p><p>something like that happened and not worry overmuch about the details. They called out, they received aid—that’s what’s important.</p><p>If no aid is forthcoming folks assume this is because the gods and saints are all very busy and cannot be arsed to answer every prayer. People are never surprised when the gods and saints are silent. They are usually silent.</p>"

For example, if several heroes are all attempting to climb the outside of a tower at the same time, giving each other assistance and advice, they could be asked to make a Might group test. If a group of heroes attempt to sneak by a sleeping ogre, they might make an Agility group test.</p><h3>Group Test Difficulty</h3><p>The Director determines the difficulty of a group test the same way they do for individual tests.

This collective consequence should affect everyone. An easy option is for the stress of failing the test to cause each hero to take a bane on their next power roll, or for the Director to gain 2 Malice per hero at the start of the next combat encounter. But the consequence could also be tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes fail in their attempt to sneak through the camp of an enemy army, they’re spotted and the camp immediately goes on alert as waves of enemies attack them.</p><p>If fewer than half the heroes incur a consequence or earn a reward on their individual tests, then the group test simply succeeds or fails.</p>"

        "content": "<p>When a group of heroes works together over time to accomplish a common goal that requires more than a single characteristic, the Director can call for a montage test. Such tests typically take place over a prolonged period and focus on collective or shared activities. Navigating a vast desert, convincing farmers to rise up against a tyrannical leader, and performing a ritual to open a magically sealed gate can all be accomplished with montage tests.</p><p>In a montage test, the players take turns making tests as their characters tackle a task together in a montage test round. Each hero has a chance to make a test (or to assist another hero’s test) intended to influence the outcome of the task.</p><p>A hero can also spend their turn using an item, ability, or other option they have available that they believe can help in the montage test. For example, if a group of heroes want to cross an ocean on a sailing ship before a storm begins, one hero might make use of a magic fan that creates wind to keep the sails full day and night. The Director decides that this clever action gives the heroes 2 automatic successes in the montage test, with no individual tests necessary.</p><p>Once a hero makes a test, assists with a test, or uses an ability or other option, they can’t do anything else as part of the montage test until each other hero involved in the montage test does so as well. A hero can also choose to do nothing, most often if they have no one to assist and fear that their actions might make the situation worse. Once every hero has had a chance to act, the montage test round ends and a new one begins.</p><h3>Time and Stakes</h3><p>As the name suggests, montage tests create a kind of cinematic montage in the action of the game. A montage test can take place over the course of several hours or days, with each individual test or other activity set up as a brief vignette within the montage that stars one of the heroes. Combat encounters, negotiations, and other challenges and scenes can break up a montage test.</p><p>The Director should deploy montage tests only when the players are engaged in overcoming a goal that has stakes for the story and some sort of pressure, such as a looming deadline or impending harm. A montage test is great for a race to get to another location before an enemy army does, a chase to escape or catch up to a foe, weathering a hazard, preparing a village for war, or similar activities. Low- or no-stakes activities such as travel through a forest with no time pressure, or training during a respite to use a new kit, can be narrated in montage style, but they don’t require a montage test.</p><h3>Director Sets the Scene</h3><p>At the start of a montage test, the Director should describe the scenario underlying the task at hand, and the various challenges the heroes might face as they attempt to collectively accomplish it. For example, if the heroes are chasing down a pickpocket through a crowded market, the Director might talk about the throngs of innocent people blocking the way forward, obscuring the characters’ vision, and making noise that complicates attempts to hear the thief’s nimble footsteps. There are also traveling carts to dodge, the speed and dexterity of the pursued character to contend with, and a pack of stray dogs who chase after anyone who sprints through the market. Describing these obstacles gives the heroes ideas about what they’re trying to overcome as they attempt to achieve their goals.</p><h3>Individual Tests in Montage Tests</h3><p>The difficulty of each individual test in a montage test is set by the Director and can vary from test to test. For instance, if the heroes are preparing the defenses of a village threatened by a band of approaching raiders, the Director might decide that a character who wants to dig a trench around the village needs to make an easy Might test. Another hero wants to train the untested farmers of the village in the ways of war, and the Director decides this is a hard Reason test.</p><p>The same rules and guidelines that apply to all individual tests apply in montage tests. If a hero has a clever, out-of-the-box idea that the Director thinks should automatically succeed without rolling dice, it does. If the circumstances of the test should grant an edge or a bane, they do. Individual test outcomes shouldn’t halt the story.</p><p>The Director should couch each success or failure as it relates to the overall goal of the montage test. If the heroes are trying to reach an ancient temple, failing a Might test to ford a river in their path doesn’t mean they don’t cross the river and are stuck on the other side. But it could mean that failing to cross the river in a timely manner gives a rival group of villains the chance to beat the party to the temple.</p><p>The rewards and consequences of individual tests made during a montage test are handled on an individual basis. The Director can use the default of gaining additional Malice in the next combat encounter for consequences and having the party gain hero tokens for rewards to keep the montage moving.</p><h3>Can’t Use the Same Skill Twice</h3><p>An individual character can’t use the same skill more than once in a montage test. Though multiple heroes can use the same skill, a test or an assist with a specific skill represents each characters’ entire contribution to the montage test with that skill. At the Director’s discretion, this restriction can be lifted for prolonged montage tests, or for montage tests that are limited in scope and have only a small number of skills that apply to them.</p><h3>New Challenges for Each Test</h3><p>In general, when a hero makes a test as part of a montage test, they should choose new obstacles to overcome that haven’t already been overcome as part of the test. If the heroes are chasing a thief through the marketplace and one of them has already distracted the pack of stray dogs with a deft hand and a piece of meat, additional tests made to distract the animals don’t count toward the outcome of the montage test.</p><p>When it fits the scenario, the Director can adjust this restriction. If part of a montage test involves searching for people trapped in a burning building, the Director is likely to allow multiple tests to fight or avoid the fire, since this will happen throughout the montage test, not just once.</p><h4>Introducing More Challenges</h4><p>During a montage test, a Director can introduce new challenges for the heroes to face. While attempting to run out of a burning building from the top floor, the characters might discover that by the time they reach the second floor, beams are starting to fall and glass windows are exploding as the structure starts to collapse. These new challenges can be incorporated into the tests the heroes subsequently make.</p><h3>Total Successes and Failures</h3><p>The Director or another player will track the total number of successes and failures the heroes earn during a montage test. Every montage test has a success limit and a failure limit. When the number of successful tests equals the success limit, the montage test ends and the heroes achieve total success (see <span><a>Montage Test Outcomes</a></span> below). The montage test can also end when the number of failed tests equals the failure limit, and the heroes suffer total failure.</p><h3>Limited Rounds</h3><p>A montage test should last only 2 montage test rounds. If the heroes don’t end the montage test by achieving the success limit or failure limit, the montage test ends when the second montage test round is over. This time limit helps to keep a montage test from becoming a slog, and prevents heroes from simply using their turns to assist the one hero with the best chance of success. This can inspire each hero to be a more active participant in the montage test. That said, the Director can increase the number of rounds a montage test lasts if they wish to create a particularly grueling challenge.</p><h3>Montage Test Difficulty</h3><p>The Director determines the success limit and failure limit of a montage test. They can share this information or keep it secret, depending on what feels the most fun and dramatic for the situation and the players.</p><p>In general, the higher the success limit, the harder and more complicated it is for the heroes to overcome the montage test, since a hero can’t make the same test twice. The Montage Test Difficulty table gives a recommended success limit and failure limit for easy, moderate, and hard montage tests for groups with five heroes.</p><table><caption><strong>Montage Test Difficulty</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Difficulty</p></th><th><p>Success Limit</p></th><th><p>Failure Limit</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Easy</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Moderate</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hard</p></td><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For larger or smaller groups, the Director can make the following adjustments to keep montage tests achievable but challenging:</p><ul><li>For four or fewer heroes, decrease the success limit and failure limits by 1 (to a minimum of 2) for every hero fewer than five. For example, if a group has only three heroes, an easy montage test has a success limit and failure limit of 3.</li><li>For six or more heroes, increase the success and failure limits by 1 for every hero more than five.</li></ul><h3>Montage Test Outcomes</h3><p>A montage test can have three different outcomes:</p><ul><li>If the heroes hit the success limit before hitting the failure limit or before the time runs out for the test, they achieve total success.</li><li>If the heroes hit the failure limit or time runs out, and if they’ve achieved at least two more successes than failures, they achieve a partial success.</li><li>If the heroes hit the failure limit or time runs out, and if they don’t have at least two more successes than failures, they suffer total failure.</li></ul><h4>Total Success</h4><p>If the heroes earn a total success, they achieve what they set out to do without complication. For instance, if the heroes engaged in a montage test to cross a desert and reach a city before a tyrant’s army arrives there and levels the place, a total success sees them arrive at the city gates with plenty of time to warn people of the impending assault.</p><p>The heroes earn 1 Victory when they achieve total success on an easy or moderate montage test, and 2 Victories on a hard montage test.</p><h4>Partial Success</h4><p>If the heroes earn a partial success, they succeed at what they set out to do, but there is a complication or a cost involved. For instance, when crossing the desert to reach and warn the city of the tyrant’s army, a mixed success sees the characters arrive at the city gates with the enemy forces just behind them. Alternatively, the Director might allow the heroes to arrive well before the army, but they don’t cover their movements well enough. The tyrant realizes the city has been warned and decides to call in a favor to have a powerful dragon join the siege.</p><p>The heroes earn 1 Victory when they achieve partial success on a hard or moderate montage test.</p><h4>Total Failure</h4><p>If the heroes suffer total failure, they don’t achieve what they set out to do. Just as with standard tests, failure on a group test shouldn’t bring a story to a halt. Total failure should make things more interesting and challenging! With a total failure in a montage test to cross the desert and warn the city, the characters arrive at the city to find it already under siege by the tyrant.</p><h3>Sample Montage Test</h3><p>Four heroes must cross the vast and inhospitable Infinite Desert to warn the city of Ahset that the tyrannical Empress Vardo is coming to conquer them. If the characters arrive in time, they can organize the defenses of the city, giving its people a greater chance of defeating the tyrant.</p><p>The Director determines that crossing the desert is a montage test of hard difficulty. With four heroes involved, the success limit is 6 and the failure limit is 2 as the montage test begins.</p><h4>Montage Test Round 1</h4><p>When the test begins, the Director sets the scene. They tell the players that the desert has extreme temperatures, sudden sandstorms, high dunes to cross, deep sand, chasms, and quicksand lakes. The Director decides that the challenges of dunes, deep sand, and quicksand can be tackled multiple times in the test, since the Infinite Desert is filled with these hazards.</p><p>Urdoncara, a fury, starts things off by asking to make an Intuition test using the Nature skill to predict the best times of day to travel and rest. She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert’s extreme temperatures and any sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so that the journey is quickened. The Director decides this is an easy test. Urdoncara makes the test and gets a total of 12, earning 1 success for the montage test.</p><p>Jorn, a tactician, wants to make a Reason test using the Climb skill to lead the party over dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The Director allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes one dune easier to climb than another is tricky, setting the difficulty at hard. Jorn gets a 9 on the test and fails with a consequence, which the Director decides will cause him to take a bane on his next power roll due to the exertion. The montage test has 1 success and 1 failure.</p><p>Karrel, an elementalist, thinks the group might cross the desert faster if they have specially modified sandshoes that distribute their weight and prevent their feet from sinking into the sand. The Director loves the idea, and decides that making four pairs of the shoes while traveling the desert is a medium Reason test. Karrel gets to use their Tailoring skill and winds up with a total of 13—a success with a consequence. The Director decides to gain an additional 2 Malice at the start of the next combat encounter as a consequence, but the group now has 2 successes and 1 failure on the montage test.</p><p>Val, a conduit, offers to scout ahead for the group with an Intuition test, using the Navigate skill to find the best path forward and avoid hazards such as chasms and quicksand. The Director thinks that acting as lookout in a vast desert is an easy task. Val smashes it with a 21—a success with a reward—and the Director decides to get creative. Val’s lookout skills grant the next hero to act in the montage test an edge on their test. At the end of the first montage test round, the heroes have 3 successes and 1 failure.</p><h4>Interlude</h4><p>Before the next montage test round, the Director pauses the montage test to run a battle with a kingfissure worm, who attacks the heroes as they cross over an ancient ruin partially buried in the sand. After the heroes defeat the kingfissure worm, the test continues.</p><h4>Montage Test Round 2</h4><p>Urdoncara wants to make a Might test using the Lift skill to carry most of the group’s equipment as they cross the desert, allowing her allies to move more quickly while she keeps up with her superior fortitude. The Director thinks this arduous task has a hard difficulty. Urdoncara gets a 17 on the test thanks to the edge from Val’s earlier success. The montage test has 4 successes and 1 failure.</p><p>Jorn, eager to prove himself after his last failure, asks to make a Might test using the Lead skill, representing tying a rope around his waist to drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The Director likes the idea but doesn’t think the Lead skill applies to the task. They tell Jorn that Lift is more appropriate, since the tactician is using his physical skill to aid his friends and not really doing anything interpersonal. Jorn agrees, and the Director sets the test at medium difficulty. Making the test with a bane because of his previous failure, the tactician rolls a 15, which is a success with a consequence. The montage test has 5 successes and 1 failure, but the consequence gives the Director another 2 Malice at the start of the next combat encounter.</p><p>Since the group needs only one more success to achieve total success, Karrel says she’d like to assist Val in whatever task she decides to take on. Val wants to recall lore about the Khem-hor—the inhabitants of the Infinite Desert—to remember their time-honored travel techniques using the History skill. Karrel has the Culture skill, which she can use to assist by providing information about the lives and society of the Khem-hor. She makes a Reason test to assist and gets a 16, granting Val an edge on her upcoming test.</p><p>Val attempts to recall lore about the Khem-hor, wanting to know if she can remember any of their travel from her studies of the history of the region. The Director has her make a hard Reason test with an edge, thanks to Karrel’s input on the current state of Khem-hor culture. Val gets a 17, and the Director decides that the conduit recalls a shortcut through a canyon tunnel that leads directly to Ahset, avoiding a vast lake of quicksand. The heroes get their sixth success in the montage test, achieving total success, and earn 2 Victories.</p><h4>Other Options</h4><p>The heroes could have attempted other tests during their travels, such as an Agility test using the Sneak skill to lead the group through dangerous shortcuts in the desert without being seen or waylaid by predators, a Reason test using the Nature skill to find enough food and water to keep the group hydrated and fed, or a Presence test using the Music skill to inspire allies to travel faster with song.</p>"

If you’ve never played a game with a dedicated negotiation system like this, you might need to run it once or twice before you master it, similar to learning any new subsystem in an RPG. If a player hasn’t read these rules, the Director and other players who have can explain them to that player during their first negotiation.</p><p>Negotiation is a framework for important roleplaying encounters in which the heroes want to convince an NPC to take a particular course of action, such as lending the heroes an artifact or pardoning a prisoner. This framework tracks the NPC’s interest in the hero’s arguments and their patience, so that the Director know what the NPC is willing to offer and when it’s time to end the scene. This framework shouldn’t replace roleplaying (though it certainly can if your group doesn’t enjoy that part of RPGs).

If your group prefers a game where the heroes simply work toward their goals by making project rolls, that’s fine. But using these events can help a Director inject more drama into the processes of research and crafting.</p><h4>When To Use Project Events</h4><p>Projects don’t need an event every time a hero makes a project roll. If they did, the heroes would likely spend all their time trying to manage their projects and never do any adventuring. Instead, you as the Director pick one of the following methods to determine when an event occurs during a downtime project. You can always switch up the method you use during a campaign, doing whatever you think works best for the current situation.</p><h4>Roll for Event</h4><p>If you want events to be a surprise for you as much as for the other players, then once during any respite when one or more heroes makes a project roll, roll a d6. On a 6, an event occurs. This is a good option if you enjoy coming up with story on the fly during play.</p><h4>Event Milestones</h4><p>If you want to guarantee that events occur during a downtime project, use event milestones based on project points. When the project accrues a certain number of points, an event occurs the next time a hero wants to make a project roll. This approach works well if you want to plan your event in detail before it occurs.</p><p>You can use the Suggested Event Milestones table to determine when an event should occur during a project.</p><table><caption><strong>Suggested Event Milestones</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Project Goal</p></th><th><p>Milestones</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>30 or fewer</p></td><td><p>None</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>31–200</p></td><td><p>One event halfway to the goal</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>201–999</p></td><td><p>Two events at one-third and two-thirds of the way to the goal</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1,000 or more</p></td><td><p>Three events at one-quarter, one-half, and three-quarters of the way to the goal</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Whenever You Want</h4><p>Whenever you think the heroes could use a little drama during a respite, throw in an event. This approach allows you to plan an event in detail when a downtime project starts, then deploy it at the most dramatic moment—or even throw it in during an encounter if you’re feeling saucy!</p><h4>Deploying Events</h4><p>A project event occurs when a hero makes a project roll. You can roll for or choose an event from the appropriate events prompts table, or use the tables to inspire your own events. Each event entry on the table is a narrative prompt written for you as the Director, and which you can change and flesh out as you determine. Each event specifies whether it occurs before or after the project roll is resolved.</p><h4>Automatic Breakthrough</h4><p>If an event grants an automatic breakthrough on a downtime project, the project gains 20 project points and the hero can make another project roll for the same project as part of the same respite activity.</p>"

If you gain an edge on a project roll, you add 2 to the roll, as usual. But if you have a double edge, you add 4 to the roll. Likewise, you subtract 2 from a project roll that takes a bane, and you subtract 4 from a roll that has a double bane.</p><h3>Skills and Project Rolls</h3><p>You can apply skills from either the crafting or lore skill groups to project rolls that directly relate to a downtime project. For example, you could use the Tailoring skill for project rolls related to making a magic cloak, and you could use the History skill while attempting to research the location of an ancient battle where a magic crown was lost. At the Director’s discretion, you can also use skills from other skill groups, but a skill used for a project roll must be directly related to the project.</p><h3>Language and Project Rolls</h3><p>If you know the language of a project source, you can make a project roll without any issues. If you don’t know the language of the source but you know a related language, the project roll takes a bane. If you don’t know the source’s language or a related language, the project roll has a double bane.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Skills represent the different specializations a hero has outside of attacking, defending, and using their ancestry features, class features, and equipment. Whenever you make a test, having a particular skill associated with the test increases your chance of success.</p><h3>Applying Skills</h3><p>If you have a skill that applies to a test you make, you gain a +2 bonus to the test. For instance, if your hero has the Hide skill, you have a +2 bonus to any test you make that involves hiding yourself. This might include an Agility test to hide behind a barrel, or a Presence test to disappear into a crowd.</p><p>The +2 bonus gained for a skill isn’t an edge. A player can make a test that has both the +2 bonus for a skill and the +2 bonus for an edge.</p><p>You can’t apply more than one skill to a test.</p><h4>Justify the Skill</h4><p>It’s not the Director’s job to know every task potentially covered by the skills in the game, or to know the specific skills your hero has. Instead, the Director asks you to make a test using a characteristic and you tell the Director if you think you have a skill that applies. If it’s not obvious why the skill applies, tell the Director how your hero is approaching the task and justify why that approach uses the skill. The Director then decides if you get the +2 bonus the skill represents. If the Director disagrees with you, that’s the final word.</p><p>Approaching problems creatively while remaining reasonable can help you get the most out of your skills. For example, if you’re making a Presence test to impress a noble at a party, using the Brag skill is an obvious choice. But what if you don’t have that skill? Maybe you could instead try to impress the noble with a brief but exciting lecture about the nature of the elements, making a Presence test using the Magic skill that you do have!</p><p>Sometimes you won’t have a skill that applies to a test. That’s okay! If your characteristic score is decent, you likely have a good chance of success without a skill.</p><h4>Mixing Characteristics and Skills</h4><p>Although certain skills are often paired with one characteristic more than others, a skill can apply to a test made using any characteristic that makes sense. The Director has the final say on which characteristic is used to complete a task, and can call for a different characteristic based on the circumstances.</p><p>For example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal threat is a Presence test. But if a player describes their character tearing a log in half with their bare hands to intimidate a foe, the Director is likely to call for a Might test instead. The Intimidate skill can apply to both tests. In the same way, scaling the side of a building is covered by a Might test, but if a hero does a series of leaps from one balcony to another to reach a roof, the Director could call for an Agility test instead. The Climb skill applies to both of these tests.</p><h3>Many Specific Skills</h3><p><em>Draw Steel</em> includes a big list of skills, and each is fairly specific. For example, instead of one Athletics skill that covers climbing, jumping, swimming, and lifting heavy objects, your character might use separate Climb, Jump, Lift, and Swim skills. Instead of a Thievery skill that covers picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps, the game has three skills: Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Sabotage.</p><p>Having a wide range of specific skills means you’ll frequently make tests that don’t use one of your character’s skills, simply applying a characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it means that having a character who covers the spread of every skill is actually impossible. Luckily, the math of the game doesn’t require you to have a skill to have a decent chance of success on a test. That means heroes can attempt tasks without the help of a skill just because someone needs to do it, and that’s pretty darn heroic!</p><p>Since you don’t need to worry about your character covering a wide spread of skills, you’re free to choose the skills you think fit your hero best and are the most fun to work with. Maybe you’re thinking about an elementalist who has a gymnastic background in jumping and tumbling, and who also studied religion and blacksmithing. Having that kind of specific backstory is a big part of cinematic storytelling.</p><p>The rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly applied to any test that is appropriate for the skill. This encourages clever thinking. A player can ask the Director, “I want to impress the duke with a story about how I ascended the sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Climb skill for a +2 bonus to my Presence test?” Getting creative like that is a lot of fun. It paints a visual picture, and it’s good tactical thinking! However, if the skills in a game are too broad in the kinds of activities they represent, players inevitably end up applying the same skill over and over again to as many tests as possible. This isn’t fun for anyone, and doesn’t make a very compelling story.</p><aside><p class=\"charm top-charm\"></p><h3 data-no-toc>Edges on Tests With Specific Skills</h3><p>Certain features and abilities grant a creature an edge on tests made with a specific skill. A creature making a test where the specific skill would apply gains an edge on the test even if they don’t have the skill. For example, the conduit’s Blessing of Fortunate Weather can create foggy weather that grants creatures who make tests using the Hide skill an edge on those tests. Any creature who attempts to hide in the fog gains an edge on the test as long as the Hide skill would apply to that test, regardless of whether they have that skill or not.</p><p class=\"charm bottom-charm\"></p></aside><aside><p class=\"charm top-charm\"></p><h3 data-no-toc>Are All Skills Equal?</h3><p>When choosing skills for your character, deciding which skills will be most useful depends a lot on the campaign. For instance, the Swim skill might be used constantly during a campaign that takes place on the ocean and has heroes exploring underwater ruins, but it won’t come up as much in a campaign that takes place entirely in a vast desert. The Psionics skill might come up a lot in a campaign where voiceless talkers are the main foes, and Magic might be more useful in a game where the heroes take on a circle of evil wizards. If you’re worried about whether a skill you’d like to take will be useful, discuss your skill list with the Director after you create a hero. And if a skill doesn’t work out, you can always trade it for another skill as you wish (see @UUID[Compendium.draw-steel-heroes.journal.JournalEntry.dsheroes03chapte.JournalEntryPage.03changingchar00]{Changing Character Options} in Chapter 2: Making a Hero).</p><p class=\"charm bottom-charm\"></p></aside><h3>Skill Groups</h3><p>Skills are broken down into five skill groups: crafting, exploration, interpersonal, intrigue, and lore.</p><h4>Crafting Skills</h4><p>Skills from the crafting skill group are used in the creation and appraisal of goods and for jury-rigging contraptions. They are especially useful during rests and downtime.</p><p>Rewards for tests made with crafting skills typically include having leftover rare material used in the creation process, knowing a buyer willing to pay extra for goods or items you’re appraising, or making a jury-rigged device so amazing that it lasts for more uses than it should.</p><p>Consequences for tests made with crafting skills typically include wasting rare materials used in the creation process, greatly overestimating or underestimating an item’s value, and poorly jury-rigging a contraption so that it harms people (or at least the wrong people).</p><table><caption><strong>Crafting Skills</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Alchemy</p></td><td><p>Make bombs and potions</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Architecture</p></td><td><p>Create buildings and vehicles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blacksmithing</p></td><td><p>Forge metal armor and weapons</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Carpentry</p></td><td><p>Create items out of wood</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cooking</p></td><td><p>Create delicious dishes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fletching</p></td><td><p>Make ranged weapons and ammunition</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Forgery</p></td><td><p>Create false badges, documents, and other items</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jewelry</p></td><td><p>Create bracelets, crowns, rings, and other jewelry</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mechanics</p></td><td><p>Build machines and clockwork items</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tailoring</p></td><td><p>Craft clothing of cloth or leather</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Exploration Skills</h4><p>Skills from the exploration skill group are used to physically explore the environment around the characters, and to overcome physical obstacles.</p><p>Rewards for tests made with exploration skills typically include helping another creature engaging in the same task succeed without needing to also make a test, automatically succeeding on a follow-up test while engaged in the same task, reaching a destination faster than anticipated, and learning about or avoiding an upcoming hazard.</p><p>Consequences for tests made with exploration skills include harming yourself, your gear, or your allies; becoming lost; or stumbling headlong into a hazard or a place you were trying to avoid.</p><table><caption><strong>Exploration Skills</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Climb</p></td><td><p>Move up vertical surfaces</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Drive</p></td><td><p>Control vehicles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Endurance</p></td><td><p>Remain engaged in strenuous activity over a long period of time</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gymnastics</p></td><td><p>Move across unsteady or narrow surfaces; tumble</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heal</p></td><td><p>Use mundane first aid</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jump</p></td><td><p>Leap vertical and horizontal distances</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lift</p></td><td><p>Pick up, carry, and throw heavy objects</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Navigate</p></td><td><p>Read a map and travel without becoming lost</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ride</p></td><td><p>Ride and control a nonsapient mount, such as a horse</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Swim</p></td><td><p>Move through deep liquid</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Interpersonal Skills</h4><p>Skills from the interpersonal skill group are used to socially interact with other creatures, and are particularly useful during negotiations (see <span><a href=\"ds-heroes-raw-new.html#_idTextAnchor2017\">Chapter 11: Negotiation</a></span>). Aside from the Handle Animals skill, you can generally only use interpersonal skills when you attempt to influence creatures who have emotions and who can understand you.</p><p>Rewards for tests made with interpersonal skills typically include gaining an extra favor, item, or piece of information from the people or creatures you interact with.</p><p>Consequences for tests made with interpersonal skills include making the creature you’re interacting with angry, sad, embarrassed, offended, or otherwise upset or uncomfortable. This might cause them to ignore you, storm off, spread rumors about you, attack you, betray you, blackmail you, or otherwise attempt to harm you.</p><table><caption><strong>Interpersonal Skills</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Brag</p></td><td><p>Impress others with stories of your deeds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Empathize</p></td><td><p>Relate to someone on a personal level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Flirt</p></td><td><p>Attract romantic attention from someone</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gamble</p></td><td><p>Make bets with others</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Handle Animals</p></td><td><p>Interact with nonsapient animal wildlife</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Interrogate</p></td><td><p>Obtain information from a creature withholding it</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intimidate</p></td><td><p>Awe or scare a creature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lead</p></td><td><p>Inspire people to action</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lie</p></td><td><p>Convince someone that a falsehood is true</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Music</p></td><td><p>Perform music vocally or with an instrument</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Perform</p></td><td><p>Engage in dance, oratory, acting, or some other physical performance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Persuade</p></td><td><p>Convince someone to agree with you through use of your charms and grace</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Read Person</p></td><td><p>Read the emotions and body language of other creatures</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Intrigue Skills</h4><p>Skills from the intrigue skill group are used in tasks centered around investigation, thievery, and spycraft.</p><p>Rewards for tests made with skills from this group typically include helping another creature engaging in the same task succeed without needing to also make a test, automatically succeeding on a follow-up test while engaged in the same task, discovering helpful information in addition to what you set out to learn, and performing an extra bit of clandestine activity in addition to what you set out to do.</p><p>Consequences for tests made with intrigue skills include getting caught in the act or failing to notice a detail that places you in danger, such as triggering a trap or walking into an ambush.</p><table><caption><strong>Intrigue Skills</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Alertness</p></td><td><p>Intuitively sense the details of your surroundings</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Conceal Object</p></td><td><p>Hide an object on your person or in your environment</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Disguise</p></td><td><p>Change your appearance to look like a different person</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Eavesdrop</p></td><td><p>Actively listen to something that is hard to hear, such as a whispered conversation through a door</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Escape Artist</p></td><td><p>Escape from bonds such as rope or manacles</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hide</p></td><td><p>Conceal yourself from others’ observation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pick Lock</p></td><td><p>Open a lock without using the key</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pick Pocket</p></td><td><p>Steal an item that another person wears or carries without them noticing</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sabotage</p></td><td><p>Disable a mechanical device such as a trap</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Search</p></td><td><p>Actively search an environment for important details and items</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sneak</p></td><td><p>Move silently</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Track</p></td><td><p>Follow a trail that another creature has left behind</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Lore Skills</h4><p>Skills from the lore skill group are used to research and recall specific information.

(It’s fun to roleplay these kinds of moments, so lean in!) Alternatively, the Director can make medium and hard tests with lore group skills for each hero in secret, then let the players know the narrative outcome without revealing the outcome of the power roll (see the @UUID[Compendium.draw-steel-heroes.journal.JournalEntry.dsheroes10chapte.JournalEntryPage.10reactivetest00]{Optional Rule: Secret Reactive Tests} sidebar earlier in this chapter).</p><table><caption><strong>Lore Skills</strong></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Criminal Underworld</p></td><td><p>Knowing about criminal organizations, their crimes, their relationships, and their leaders</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Culture</p></td><td><p>Knowing about a culture’s customs, folktales, and taboos</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>History</p></td><td><p>Knowing about significant past events</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magic</p></td><td><p>Knowing about magical places, spells, rituals, items, and phenomena</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Monsters</p></td><td><p>Knowing monster ecology, strengths, and weaknesses</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nature</p></td><td><p>Knowing about natural flora, fauna, and weather</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Psionics</p></td><td><p>Knowing about psionic places, spells, rituals, items, and phenomena</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Knowing about religious mythology, practices, and rituals</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rumors</p></td><td><p>Knowing gossip, legends, and uncertain truths</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Society</p></td><td><p>Knowing noble etiquette and the leadership and power dynamics of noble families</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Strategy</p></td><td><p>Knowing about battle tactics and logistics</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Timescape</p></td><td><p>Knowing about the many worlds of the timescape</p></td></tr></tbody></table><aside><p class=\"charm top-charm\"></p><h3 data-no-toc>For the Director: Make Your Own Skills</h3><p>Directors should feel free to make their own skills that they feel are relevant and useful to their campaigns and adventures.

However, a Director could decide that their campaign involves poisoned barrels of ale and large amounts of counterfeit art, and that adding these two new skills to the game would make it more fun for the players. The Director simply needs to pick a group for these new skills—in this case, crafting makes sense. They then let the players know that they can swap out any crafting skill they have for these new skills.</p><p class=\"charm bottom-charm\"></p></aside>"

        "content": "<p>Your hero’s survivability is represented by your Stamina. Think of Stamina as a combination of a creature’s physical vitality and their overall energy for dodging and resisting incoming blows, spells, and other violence. It’s not that every instance of damage deals a bleeding wound to you, but that each one chips away at your ability to fight effectively. One attack might make you sweat as you leap back to avoid an arrow, while another might graze your elbow with a dagger nick, leaving a dull, distracting pain. Eventually, this draining of energy leaves you open for bigger blows that can truly harm your body—or possibly kill you.</p><p>After any damage you take is reduced by damage immunity or other effects, your Stamina is reduced by an amount equal to the remaining damage. Some effects can also reduce your Stamina maximum, limiting the amount of Stamina you can regain.</p><h3>Recoveries and Recovery Value</h3><p>Each hero has a number of Recoveries determined by their class. A hero also has a recovery value that equals one-third of their Stamina maximum, rounded down. When you use the Catch Breath maneuver in combat (see <span><a>Maneuvers</a></span> above), you spend a Recovery and regain Stamina equal to your recovery value. Outside of combat, you can spend as many Recoveries as you have remaining. Some abilities, items, and other effects allow you to spend a Recovery to regain Stamina equal to your recovery value plus a little extra (as described by the effect), or to regain Stamina without spending a Recovery.</p><h3>Winded</h3><p>Your winded value equals half your Stamina maximum. When your Stamina is equal to or less than your winded value, you are winded. Although being winded has no effects on its own, certain ancestry, class, item, title, and monster abilities affect winded creatures.</p><p>You can tell when other creatures are winded and vice versa.</p><h3>Dying and Death</h3><p>When your Stamina is 0 or lower, you are dying. While dying, you can’t use the Catch Breath maneuver in combat. Additionally, you are bleeding, and this instance of the condition can’t be negated or removed in any way until you are no longer dying. While you are dying, you can still act, your allies can help you spend Recoveries in combat, and you can spend Recoveries out of combat as usual.</p><p>While your Stamina is lower than 0, if it reaches the negative of your winded value, you die. When you die, you can’t be brought back to life without the use of a special powerful item, such as a Scroll of Resurrection.</p><h3>Director-Controlled Creatures</h3><p>In most circumstances, Director-controlled creatures die or are destroyed when their Stamina drops to 0.</p><h4>No Recoveries</h4><p>Director-controlled creatures don’t have Recoveries or a recovery value. Any such creatures who regain Stamina during a battle do so by way of a special item or an ability in their stat block. However, there are times when a hero might wish to use an ability that allows another creature to spend a Recovery or to regain Stamina equal to their recovery value on an injured NPC. In such cases, a Director-controlled creature regains Stamina equal to one-third of their Stamina maximum.</p><h3>Knocking Creatures Out</h3><p>If you damage a creature with an ability that would kill them, you can choose to instead knock them unconscious. If a creature takes damage while unconscious in this way, they die.</p><p>Director-controlled creatures remain unconscious for 1 hour if no one does anything to wake them. They then gain 1 Stamina and are no longer unconscious.</p><p>Heroes remain unconscious for 1 hour if no one does anything to wake them. After 1 hour, they can spend a Recovery and are no longer unconscious. If the hero has no Recoveries left, they can’t wake up until they finish a respite.</p><h4>Unconscious</h4><p>While you are unconscious, you can’t take main actions, maneuvers, triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers; your speed is 0; you are unaware of your surroundings; and you are prone. Ability rolls against you have a double edge. If you wake up from being unconscious, you can stand up from prone as a free maneuver.</p><h3>Temporary Stamina</h3><p>Some abilities, treasures, and other effects grant a creature temporary Stamina. Temporary Stamina shouldn’t be included in a creature’s Stamina total when figuring out a creature’s recovery value or winded value. If you have temporary Stamina while winded, dying, or dead, the temporary Stamina doesn’t change those states.</p><p>Whenever you take damage while you have temporary Stamina, the temporary Stamina decreases first, and any leftover damage is applied to your Stamina as usual. For instance, if you have 10 temporary Stamina and take 16 damage, you lose the temporary Stamina and then lose another 6 Stamina.</p><p>There is no maximum to how much temporary Stamina you can have. Regaining Stamina can’t restore temporary Stamina. If you have temporary Stamina and then gain more temporary Stamina, you get whichever amount of temporary Stamina is greater, rather than adding the two pools together. For instance, if an ability grants you 10 temporary Stamina when you already have 5, you have 10 temporary Stamina, not 15.</p><p>Unless otherwise indicated, temporary Stamina disappears at the end of an encounter.</p><h3>Object Stamina</h3><p>Mundane objects in the game have Stamina based on the material they’re made of. When an object’s Stamina is reduced to 0, the object is destroyed. Objects have poison immunity all and psychic immunity all, though the Director can remove one or both of these immunities in the case of living objects, such as plants. A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of common materials has Stamina as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Glass:</strong> 1 Stamina</li><li><strong>Wood:</strong> 3 Stamina</li><li><strong>Stone:</strong> 6 Stamina</li><li><strong>Metal:</strong> 9 Stamina</li></ul><p>The Director can decide that a well-made or poorly made object has more or less Stamina. Destroying a supernatural object often (but not always) requires a specific quest, such as throwing a magic ring back into the volcano where it was forged.</p>"

Old fashioned people still use the archaic term “plane” to describe these worlds, while sages use geometric formulae, describing these worlds they call “manifolds,” but they all mean the same thing.</p><p>Higher worlds are more energetic, affording access to alien technologies. Great starfreighters ply the space-lanes, and knights wield psionically powered hard-light blades dueling against star pirates with hard-light blasters.</p><p>The lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such extraordinary technology to function, and so rely on magic to break the rules.</p><p>On Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL, the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade across the upper worlds, defending the starfreighters from the time raiders and the infamous pirate band the Starslayers on their legendary ship the <span class=\"footnote\" data-tooltip-text=\"Kuran’zoi Rapid Attack Dreadnought\">K.R.A.D.</span> <em>Fearless</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the formless proteans rebelled against the synliroi who once ruled the Plane of Uttermost Chaos, exiling the voiceless talkers to the World Below. Now masters of their world, the proteans take to the stars in their living changeships, hurling their small fleet against the tyrannical unquestioned might of UNISOL.</p><p>On Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds, proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire dwarves, even humans in Quintessence’s capital city of Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the gateway to the timescape. People travelling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible law of UNISOL.</p><p>Traveling downward from Quintessence one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. Technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind or the miracle mineral iridoss, also known as prismacore.</p><p>Almost coterminal with Orden is its sister-manifold, the World Below, the Dark Under All, a plane of exiles ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star’s Silver, the Queen of Night, first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves, and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, only endless caverns and warrens, some vast enough to hold entire cities, like Or-Mazaar City of the Black Star from which the Queen of Night rules.</p><p>The power of the World Below wanes, while the power of Equinox waxes. A smaller, parasitic manifold home to the twilight celestials and their servants the shadow elves, Equinox is ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below who plots to bridge the sea between worlds and colonize Orden making a new home for her people before their old world dies. A fierce, fairy-tale, weird magic, jungle world of permanent twilight also known as Dusk.</p><p>The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell is among the lowest of the lower planes. A land of devils proud of their civilization, each of the seven cities is ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. A world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more <em>interesting</em> down here.</p><p>The seven archdevils conspired together once; agreeing to create the Order of Desolation—also known as the Illriggers—to extend their power into the timescape, and defend Hell from the horde of demons below.</p><p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience and gain identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upwards, out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identity, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.</p><p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City, a city of the dead, ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the Heliopolis.</p>"

While there will someday be nations here with proper borders, as of now in the Age of Chaos those nations are merely geographic areas with names people use to distinguish lands that share similar terrain and subcultures.</p><p>Aendrim, the land of hills and farms. Corwell with its knights and castles. The marshlands of Tull where witches and wise women battle hags and swamp monsters. The thick forests of Farrow with its bands of archers, and the horselands of Graid home to the best cavalry in Orden.</p><p>Mountainous northeastern Vasloria is home to the small earldoms of Sednia, Olvaria, and Sărda, and the earldom of Rhöl containing the land of Glauer once ruled by a deathless count.</p><p>Scattered across it all, Vasloria boasts the densest collection of elf-haunted wodes in Orden. All regions have wodes, but Vasloria’s northern border is the Great Wode where the world still works as it did before humans arrived.</p><p>Within the wodes, time misbehaves. Cause and effect are only distant cousins, as all lands were before Ord placed the dwarves in the world, imposing the Law of Time on Orden. Children’s tales of villagers wandering into a wode and emerging unchanged 100 years later are based on real events. When pressed on how this “works,” the elves look baffled. “How does what work?”</p><h4>Omund’s Land</h4><p>Western Vasloria, including most of Aendrim and Corwell and parts of Graid, was until recently ruled by Good King Omund. His draconian knights, the Dragon Phalanx, protected the weak from the strong, dispensing justice. Omund’s rule lasted 35 years and in his life this area was known as Omund’s Land.</p><p>Under Omund’s rule, order thrived. Roads were safe. People could even walk into the woods unafraid of meeting anything more threatening than a nymph or conversational manticore.</p><p>Omund died 15 years ago and so died the rule of law. Now the forest claims the towns and roads once held safe. The woods are dangerous. Their only law … tooth and claw.</p><p>Omund was betrayed and his castle fell to Ajax the Invincible, now called the Iron Saint. His wizard Mortum unlocked the secret of the ancient sky elf flying cities, and raised the Chrysopolis, Ajax’s city-fortress in the sky.</p><p>It was Mortum who used the secrets of the synliroi Body Banks, granting immortality to those nobles who voluntarily submit to Ajax. Those same Body Banks produce Ajax’s war dogs, his brutal, patchwork-soldiers who owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically.</p><p>Ajax abolished all faiths and temples. He executed the dukes who organized and united the barons, leaving the far-flung baronies to try and hold human civilization together. Once, these people were loose allies. There was trade between humans, elves, dwarves and orcs.</p><p>Now there is only suspicion.</p><p><strong>The high elves of the fallen city </strong>pay tribute with ancient artifacts they plunder from the fallen celestial city of Irranys. <strong>The wode elves of the Orchid Court</strong>, lacking any centralized government or cities, refuse to bow to Ajax.</p><p><strong>The dwarves of Kal Kalavar </strong>pay tribute in prisoners they abduct from those foolish enough to travel the roads unescorted. These prisoners serve Ajax as forced labor or are fed into the Body Banks. Brooding under the mountains in their fabled Hanging City, the stone dwarves do not like this deal with the Overlord but lack the power—or the will—to rebel.</p><p><strong>The Hawklords of the High Aeries</strong>, once remote and proud, almost mythical to the people below, made their own pact with Ajax to avoid extermination. They now serve as his elite counterinsurgent force. Mounted on their giant hawks, they project Ajax’s power, enforce his law and extend his influence into every corner of the wilderness. Their mastery of the air means any revolt or rebellion is quickly seen and crushed.</p><p><strong>The Dragon Phalanx </strong>is broken. Ajax placed a high bounty on its warriors’ heads. Some folk still see Omund’s knights as symbols of justice, heroes of a lost age before might made right. But in every town, every village, there are always desperate people willing to collect the bounty, summoning the Hawklords to pluck any dragon knight foolish enough to travel without a disguise away to the Chrysopolis.</p><p>Isolated and outnumbered, the human baronies desperately fight a losing battle against the encroaching wilderness. Order dies. Chaos thrives.</p>"

Being able to afford a suit of armor or a stay at an inn doesn’t do much good in the middle of a trackless forest, an empty desert, or a remote dungeon ruin.

For example, a hero with Wealth 3 can easily buy a small house, but that Wealth doesn’t mean they can buy up every available small house in the local area to become a landlord.</p><p>The table isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list, but you and the Director can use it to judge what your character can and can’t purchase. For instance, the relative value of an ox isn’t on the table, but you can reasonably assume that if you can buy a horse, you can probably afford an ox as well. (Don’t @ us, farm nerds.) And if you can’t afford something you want, fear not! You might still be able to acquire a specific good or service through negotiation, or by trading your heroic services instead of spending cash.</p><p>Treasures such as magic swords, psionic crowns, and even healing potions are rare to the point where they don’t appear on the Hero Wealth table.
