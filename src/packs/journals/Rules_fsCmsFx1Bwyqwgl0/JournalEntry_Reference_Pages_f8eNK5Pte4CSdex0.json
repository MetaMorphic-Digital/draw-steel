After all, a monster with a high Might should be harder to knock prone most of the time than a creature lacking in that characteristic.</p><p>Ability effects that have a <strong>potency</strong> are applied to a target only if the effect’s potency value is higher than the target’s indicated characteristic score. The characteristic a target uses to resist a potency is based on the ability used, while the value of the potency for your hero’s abilities is based on one of your characteristics and determined by your class.</p><p>Your character has a <strong>weak</strong>, an <strong>average</strong>, and a <strong>strong</strong> potency value, as follows:</p><ul><li>Your weak potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 2.</li><li>Your average potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 1.</li><li>Your strong potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score.</li></ul><p>In abilities and other effects, a potency always appears as the single-letter abbreviation for the target’s characteristic: <span class=\"potency-char\">M</span> for Might, <span class=\"potency-char\">A</span> for Agility, <span class=\"potency-char\">R</span> for Reason, <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> for Intuition, or <span class=\"potency-char\">P</span> for Presence. That characteristic is followed by a “less than” sign (&lt;) and your potency value—for example, <span class=\"potency-char\">M&lt;w</span> or <span class=\"potency-char\">R&lt;v</span> —with the value indicating the minimum score in that characteristic that the target needs to beat the effect.</p><p>As an example, consider the conduit’s Judgment’s Hammer ability, which has the following power roll:</p><p class=\"ability-power-potency\">Power Roll + Intuition:</p><dl class=\"power-roll-display\"><dt class=\"tier1\"><p>!</p></dt><dd><p>3 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;w</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier2\"><p>@</p></dt><dd><p>6 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;v</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier3\"><p>#</p></dt><dd><p>9 + <span class=\"potency-char\">I</span> holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;s</span> , prone and can’t stand (save ends)</p></dd></dl><p>At 1st level, a conduit uses their Intuition score to determine their potency values, and that score is 2. That gives the conduit the following potencies:</p><ul><li>Weak: 0</li><li>Average: 1</li><li>Strong: 2</li></ul><p>When writing Judgment’s Hammer on their character sheet, the conduit’s player updates the damage and converts the weak, average, and strong potencies into their numerical values, knowing that those values won’t change until the character hits 2nd echelon and their Intuition score becomes 3. That produces the following:</p><p class=\"ability-power-potency\">Power Roll + Intuition:</p><dl class=\"power-roll-display\"><dt class=\"tier1\"><p>!</p></dt><dd><p>5 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;0</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier2\"><p>@</p></dt><dd><p>8 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">a&lt;1</span> , prone</p></dd><dt class=\"tier3\"><p>#</p></dt><dd><p>11 holy damage; <span class=\"potency-char\">A&lt;2</span> , prone and can’t stand (save ends)</p></dd></dl><p>During a game session, the conduit uses Judgment’s Hammer to target a bandit with an Agility score of 0. The ability thus has the following outcomes at each tier:</p><ul><li>With a tier 1 outcome (11 or lower), the ability deals 5 holy damage to the bandit. But the bandit resists the additional effect because they have Agility 0 (and therefore don’t have an Agility of less than 0).</li><li>With a tier 2 outcome (12–16), the ability deals 8 holy damage. But the bandit is also knocked prone, unable to resist the additional effect because they would need an Agility of 1 or higher to do so. If the bandit had Agility 1 or higher, they would have taken 8 holy damage but stayed standing.</li><li>With a tier 3 outcome (17 or higher), the bandit takes 11 holy damage and is knocked flat and left struggling to stand, unable to resist the strong potency of the additional effect with a mere Agility 0.</li></ul><h4>Potency Presentation</h4><p>Potencies are presented in an abbreviated style in abilities so they don’t take up too much space, and so you can read them by saying: “If the target’s [characteristic] is less than [potency value], they [suffer effect].” If our 1st-level conduit obtained a tier 2 outcome when using Judgment’s Hammer, the player would say, “I deal 8 holy damage, and if the bandit’s Agility is less than 1, they fall prone.”</p><p>Reading the ability this way prevents a lot of back and forth. You don’t need to ask, “What’s the target’s Agility score?”, wait for a response, and then give the outcome. You can simply say, “If they don’t have an Agility of 1 or higher, they fall prone.” Players can let the Director figure out whether the target is prone and keep the game moving, with the Director doing the same in reverse when monsters and other foes use abilities with potencies against the heroes.</p><h4>Adjusting Potencies</h4><p>Potencies are made for quick resolution at the table, but a number of triggered actions and other abilities—for example, the censor’s Judgment ability and the null’s Null Field ability—allow you to manipulate the value of potencies. If you build a hero who can adjust potencies, pay attention during combat! You might be able to help out a friend who needs a little boost to make their ability take full effect, or hinder an enemy about to lock down one of your allies.</p><h4>Spending Resources on Potencies</h4><p>If an ability or feature allows you to spend your Heroic Resource on an effect that is entirely dependent on a potency and the target is unaffected because their characteristic is high enough to resist the potency, then you don’t spend the Heroic Resource.</p><p>For example, the tactician’s Overwatch ability allows the tactician to spend 1 focus to impose the slowed condition on a target who has <span class=\"potency-char\">R&lt;v</span>. Since spending focus this way has no other effect, if the tactician targets a creature whose high Reason leaves them unaffected, the tactician doesn’t waste any focus. However, if spending this focus had another automatic effect such as dealing extra damage to the target, the 1 focus would be spent even though the potency was resisted.</p><p>This rule also applies to Director-controlled creatures who spend Malice on abilities and features that affect a target using a potency and have no other automatic effects.</p>"

        "content": "<p>The Greatest City in This or Any Age! City of the Great Game! Located west across the Bale Sea from Vasloria, on the eastern coast of Rioja, Capital is not only the largest city in Orden—it’s the largest city there has ever been. Larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.</p><p>It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic where flying tapestries act as taxis, the reality of living in Capital is somewhat more mundane. Only the very wealthy can afford such luxuries.</p><p>The great houses, ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think vast wealth entitles them to rule. The great houses are very proud of their city. They believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, expect justice. They just don’t think anyone else should be able to <em>rule</em>.</p><p>The guilds, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, and largely obsessed with accruing wealth, city be damned. Three of them recently used their obscene wealth to buy great house status and now play the great game with the best of them.</p><p>The “great game” is espionage, and <strong>House Alvaro </strong>are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsor the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. While the greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the colleges in the university, which has historically doubled as the prince’s intelligence agency.</p><p><strong>House Vorona </strong>run the city’s navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy’s cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona’s Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing Capital has to a city-wide law enforcement organization. Each great house is expected to police its own district.</p><p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring that gives Vorona access to intelligence other factions can only dream of.</p><p><strong>House Navarr</strong>, oldest of the great houses, enforces the church’s law, which they call justice. Led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of the most powerful church in the city—the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless—House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and orders of knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.</p><p>Arguably the most powerful great house, <strong>House Valetta </strong>controls the Arbitros Fiat, the tax collectors. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore who, in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, opened the <em>Codex Mortis </em>and spoke the ritual which should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed every mortal in her district, including herself, into deathless revenants. Now, the Duchess Lenore is an immortal vampire queen. A dead lady, ruling over a dead city.</p><p>After the Lilac Night, when the prince was no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes they collected, Lady Shirome coordinated with two other guilds to buy Great House status for themselves.</p><p>Lady Shirome runs the city’s assayers guild, <strong>the Fulcrum</strong>. The guild controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was the Fulcrum that convinced the prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p><p>The Broadsheets, formally known as <strong>the Font</strong>, publish the thrice-daily news sheets everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in the city.</p><p>The Farrier’s Guild, popularly known as <strong>the Rasp</strong>, control transport throughout the city. Led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from Alloy who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the 13-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He created the <strong>Kites</strong>, couriers famous for getting a message anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. Kashimir’s monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives him enormous power, and he is not shy about seeking more.</p><p>Three years ago, the prince of Capital died leaving no heir or even a likely candidate. He was a young man, only forty-one, but the events surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and inaccurate accounts. Was he murdered like a commoner, or assassinated by a political rival? Evidence is scant, rumor substitutes as fact.</p><p>Now the great game takes on a new meaning as the four great houses and three newly ascendant guilds jockey for position, each wanting to step into the power vacuum left by the dead prince. Everyone knows a war is coming, a war of succession that means fighting on the street. But each player in the game would much prefer it if someone <em>else</em> made the first move.</p>"

The Director determines the exact nature of the consequence, which is typically related to the specific task.</p><p>For instance, if a hero suffers a consequence while trying to climb a wall, they might make it halfway up the wall and then fall, taking damage and landing prone. A hero trying to sneak by cultists might be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence strikes when a hero attempts to bribe a prison guard, the guard might decide to arrest the hero or lead them into a trap. If a hero suffers a consequence on a Reason test made to recall lore about the king’s favorite meal, they might confuse it for a dish to which the monarch is deathly allergic.</p><p>Not all consequences need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a hero might fail with a consequence on a test made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a noble. The failure means the cheating is noticed, but the Director decides that the noble doesn’t say anything. This consequence isn’t made apparent until later in the evening, when the noble has guards surround the hero, intent on taking the cheater down to the dungeon for stacking the deck.</p><p>Common consequences for failing a test include the following:</p><ul><li>Making an NPC so upset that they storm off, or betray, attack, or otherwise attempt to harm you</li><li>Drawing the attention of a group of foes</li><li>Triggering a trap or hazard that captures or significantly harms you or an ally</li><li>Breaking an important piece of equipment that is difficult to replace or repair</li><li>Thinking you know something that you don’t</li><li>Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved with a negotiation or a montage test you didn’t need to make before</li></ul><p>In lieu of other consequences, the Director also has the option to gain 2 additional Malice—a resource that creatures run by the Director use in combat—at the start of the next combat encounter.</p><hr /><h4>Success With a Consequence</h4><p>If you succeed on a test and incur a consequence, you do what you set out to do, but with an added cost. A hero might succeed in climbing up a wall, but the surface of the wall crumbles and becomes unstable as they do, making the climb more difficult for the ally ascending after them. When trying to sneak by a cultist, a hero successfully does so, but leaves footprints or other evidence of trespassing behind. If a hero bribes a guard to be allowed to sneak into a prison, the guard lets them in—but then demands a gemstone the hero needs for an important crafting project before they let the hero out.</p><p>Just like failure with a consequence, the consequences accompanying success don’t need to be immediately apparent. In lieu of other consequences, the Director has the option to gain 2 additional Malice at the start of the next combat encounter.</p><p>When a hero rolls a success with a consequence, the Director might give them a chance to fail instead. For instance, when a hero rolls a 10 on an easy Agility test to pick the lock on a chest, that’s a success with a consequence. The Director could suggest that the character has opened the lock but broken their lockpicks in the process (knowing the picks can’t be replaced until the hero returns to town), but can also give them the option of failing to pick the lock but keeping their lockpicks intact.</p>"

At 1st level, player characters are already known as heroes and have the power to save their local village. By the time the characters are 10th level, people all over the world—maybe even across all worlds—know the names of their saviors!</p><p>Since this game encompasses power levels from hometown heroes to demigods, the core experience has been divided into four different echelons. Each echelon determines the types of threats the heroes can take on, the stakes of their stories, and the rewards they receive at the various levels of play.</p><h3>1st Echelon (1st to 3rd Level)</h3><p>The 1st echelon of play details the stories of characters of 1st to 3rd level. At this echelon, the characters are local heroes. They save lost caravans, besieged villages, and overlooked neighborhoods within cities. Characters battle bands of mortal humanoids—dwarves, elves, goblins, humans, kobolds, orcs, and more. They can also face off against the occasional larger monstrous threat, such as a bredbeddle, ogre, or chimera. Such creatures can threaten a small community but rarely have plans for world domination or the destruction of the timescape. However, any of these adversaries might work for or be manipulated by stronger threats as a foreshadowing of what awaits the heroes at higher echelons.</p><h3>2nd Echelon (4th to 6th Level)</h3><p>The 2nd echelon of play covers 4th to 6th level. At this echelon, the heroes are now known throughout the wider region they serve. In Vasloria, this means the characters might save and be celebrated by an entire country. In Capital, their reputation and work could encompass several different neighborhoods of the enormous city. Heroes of the timescape might be known for saving a planet!</p><p>Heroes in this echelon battle humanoids of great supernatural power, such as draconians, devils, and hobgoblins. They face bosses possessed of cunning and ambition as great as their terrible influence, such as medusas and overminds. Heroes at this level also face the humanoid threats of earlier levels, but those foes are villainous counterparts of equal power rather than bands of ruffians or marauding armies.</p><h3>3rd Echelon (7th to 9th Level)</h3><p>The 3rd echelon of play covers 7th to 9th level. At this echelon, the heroes are saving and are known throughout the setting where they serve. Most folks in Vasloria, Capital, or across the larger timescape know of the heroes and are grateful for their efforts saving the continent, the entire city, or multiple worlds, respectively. Foes at this echelon include beings of great power such as giants, vampires, and valok.</p><h3>4th Echelon (10th Level)</h3><p>The 4th echelon of play explores the stories of characters of 10th level (and might even go beyond in future products). At this echelon, heroes are saving the entire timescape from threats such as liches, powerful dragons, and overlords like Ajax the Invincible.</p>"

In spite of this the people of Orden, regardless of ancestry, do not believe the gods control everything that happens in the world. They believe the gods created a natural world with its own cycles that are sometimes predictable, but which cannot be understood. It rained last Lyleth, and the Lyleth before that, so it’ll probably rain this Lyleth—but maybe not! And if not, that may be because the gods are displeased. But it might just as easily be because the gods are bored, or fickle or—even more likely, it has nothing to do with the gods, and there’s no way to know which.</p><p>When a river floods or crops fail, some people may curse the gods, but those people do not all believe a god caused these events. They may curse simply because the gods didn’t prevent catastrophe. They do not think, “Why did the gods do that?” They think, “Why did the gods make a world that behaves like this?”</p><p>The gods are powerful, but forbidden from acting directly upon or within the world. To enact their will, they use intermediaries—beings of demigod-like status, once mortals, who now serve their patron god in eternity. Many humans call these beings saints, while the other speaking peoples use the term heroes, or legendary heroes, not to be confused with the heroes you make using the character creation rules in this book.</p><p>Each god has many saints, some obscure. They sometimes manifest in the world. These encounters are always brief, leading sages and theologians to conclude there must be some limit to how much time or energy these saints and legendary heroes can spend on the prime manifold. Who created or enforces these limits?</p><p>No one knows.</p><p>As a result of this complex tapestry of belief and personalities, a farmer in Aendrim might call upon Adûn for strength while tilling the earth. But if a cool breeze suddenly came along, easing the bite of the sun on their back, they would almost certainly not thank Adûn or any of his saints. They would probably thank Saint Elspeth the Blithe, sometimes called the Summer Breeze. If they had a neighbor or relative with a shrine to Saint Elspeth in their home, they might give that person a small gift or offering and ask them to place it on their shrine. More likely, they would silently promise to do this, and then forget or get distracted.</p><p>If questioned about this—“Why did you call upon one god, but thank the saint of a completely different god?”—they would first be surprised by the question. It would not have occurred to them to examine this behavior. If pressed they would say, “Oh, I’m sure they worked it out between them.” They would not imagine, “Adûn told Viras, who told her saint, Elspeth, to send a cooling breeze,” but they would assume</p><p>something like that happened and not worry overmuch about the details. They called out, they received aid—that’s what’s important.</p><p>If no aid is forthcoming folks assume this is because the gods and saints are all very busy and cannot be arsed to answer every prayer. People are never surprised when the gods and saints are silent. They are usually silent.</p>"

For example, if several heroes are all attempting to climb the outside of a tower at the same time, giving each other assistance and advice, they could be asked to make a Might group test. If a group of heroes attempt to sneak by a sleeping ogre, they might make an Agility group test.</p><h3>Group Test Difficulty</h3><p>The Director determines the difficulty of a group test the same way they do for individual tests.

This collective consequence should affect everyone. An easy option is for the stress of failing the test to cause each hero to take a bane on their next power roll, or for the Director to gain 2 Malice per hero at the start of the next combat encounter. But the consequence could also be tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes fail in their attempt to sneak through the camp of an enemy army, they’re spotted and the camp immediately goes on alert as waves of enemies attack them.</p><p>If fewer than half the heroes incur a consequence or earn a reward on their individual tests, then the group test simply succeeds or fails.</p>"
