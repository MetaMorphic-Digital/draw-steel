      "value": "<p>A supernatural spirit who has taken the form of a specific small animal or animated object has chosen to be your familiar—or to adopt you as their familiar.</p><p>The spirit uses the @UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.monsters.Actor.cBkB3TyhBE1UsNGM]{familiar} stat block.</p><p>The familiar can hold small objects in their mouth or claws, but can’t perform activities that would typically require hands (opening a door, unrolling a scroll, and so forth). They can’t harm other creatures or objects. They can flank in combat, but only with you.</p><p>If your familiar is destroyed, you can restore them as a respite activity, or by spending a Recovery as a main action to bring them back into existence in an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p>",
