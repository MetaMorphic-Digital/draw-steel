      "value": "<p>In a long-ago age, a cataclysm overtook your city. You weren’t killed, but some arcane accident caused you to be suspended in time until now. Alone, you must navigate the world around you with a head full of outdated memories—and a few ancient secrets. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a damage type from acid, cold, corruption, fire, holy, lightning, poison, psychic, or sonic. Whenever you use a signature ability, you can have it deal your chosen damage type instead of its usual damage. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You automatically fail any test made to recall information from the period during which you were suspended in time.</p>",
