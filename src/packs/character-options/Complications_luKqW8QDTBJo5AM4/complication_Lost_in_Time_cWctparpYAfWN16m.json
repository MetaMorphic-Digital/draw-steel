      "value": "<p>In a long-ago age, a cataclysm overtook your city. You weren’t killed, but through some arcane accident you were suspended in time - until now. Alone, you must navigate the modern world with a head full of outdated memories - and a few ancient secrets.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a damage type from acid, cold, corruption, fire, holy, lightning, poison, psychic, or sonic. When you use a signature ability, you can use your chosen damage type instead of the ability’s normal damage.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You automatically fail any test made to recall information from after you were suspended in time.</p>",
