Either way, you have a malady that is best not discussed in public, lest the torches and pitchforks make their appearance.\n\nNote: Stormwight furies can’t take this complication.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you wind or kill a non-minion creature, you gain a surge.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> If you have five or more surges at the start of your turn, or you have at least one surge at the start of your turn while in moonlight, you lose all your surges and become a woflish hybrid until the end of your turn. While in the form, you either make a melee free strike at the nearest creature or shift up to your speed towards the nearest creature and make a melee free strike against them if you can. If allies and enemies are equally close, you attack an ally.</p>",
