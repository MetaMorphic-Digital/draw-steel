Your mentor said you had a special gift, and you could have become a master of your craft - but before your training was complete, your mentor was killed.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one of your skills from the crafting skill group. When you use this skill you gain an edge.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whoever killed your mentor cursed you. Whenever you make a test that you donâ€™t apply one of your skills to, you have a bane on the test.</p>",
