You’ve managed to rig the collar so it explodes outward while keeping you safe. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Even if you are a war dog yourself, other war dogs can’t use their Posthumous Promotion ability on you while you wear your collar. Additionally, you have the Posthumous Retirement ability.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Each time you use your Posthumous Retirement ability, the Director can spend 3 Malice to make your collar malfunction and deal its damage to you in addition to the usual targets.</p>",
