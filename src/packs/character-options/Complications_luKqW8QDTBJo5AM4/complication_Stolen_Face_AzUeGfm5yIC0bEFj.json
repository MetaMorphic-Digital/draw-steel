      "value": "<p>An evil fairy cursed you, leaving you with a blank expanse instead of a face. Although you’re able to imitate other peoples’ features, you’d like to have your own back.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can spend 5 uninterrupted minutes to rearrange your face into that of another creature of your ancestry who you’ve seen before. You gain a double edge on tests made to impersonate this creature or to disguise your identity. You are unable to change your hair or other non-facial features.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you take damage, your face is blank, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears. Your face doesn’t return until you spend 5 uninterrupted minutes rearranging it.</p>",
