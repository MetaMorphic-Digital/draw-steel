Their current whereabouts and activities are unknown, though disturbing rumors are heard from time to time. Even worse, as their former pupil, you’re now under suspicion as well.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You know the Corrupt Spirit maneuver, taught to you by your mentor. (In retrospect, that probably should have aroused your suspicion.)</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You have holy weakness 1. Each time you use Corrupt Spirit, your holy weakness increases by 1, to a maximum equal to [[lookup @recoveries.recoveryValue]]{your recovery value}. Whenever you take holy damage, this weakness resets to 1.</p>",
