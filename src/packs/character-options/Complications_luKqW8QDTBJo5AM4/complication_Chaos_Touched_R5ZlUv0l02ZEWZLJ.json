Now you can sprout and retract your limbs in a way that horrifies unprepared onlookers. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain an edge on the Escape Grab, Grab, and Knockback maneuvers. Additionally, you can hold an additional item even when your hands are full. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While dying, you grow and retract uncoordinated limbs at random, imposing a bane on your power rolls.</p>",
