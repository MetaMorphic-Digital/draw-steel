      "value": "<p>You spent many years imprisoned for a crime you didnâ€™t commit. During your long hours of solitary confinement, you honed your skills and recited the names of those who framed you. Someday, you will have your revenge. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have two skills of your choice, neither of which can be from the interpersonal skill group. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your health suffered in prison. Whenever you are winded, you are stricken with a hacking cough that makes it impossible for you to hide or sneak.</p>",
