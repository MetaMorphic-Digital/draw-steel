      "value": "<p>A supernatural spirit shares your body; each of you controls your body by turn. You and the spirit share the same short-term goals and work equally well with your companions, although you may have different personalities, mannerisms, and long-term goals.</p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> At the start of each day, roll 1d6. On a 1-4, you control your body. On a 5-6, the spirit does. Alternatively, if you and the spirit are on good terms, you can choose each day who is in control. Choose three of your skills that you possess only while you are in control, and choose three new skills that you can use only while your spirit is in control.</p>",
