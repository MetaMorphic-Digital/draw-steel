To pay it off, you’ll need to take some dangerous risks. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You’re good with money—because you’ve had to be. Whenever you earn Wealth, you earn 1 more than usual. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your starting Wealth is −5. While your Wealth is lower than 1, you can purchase items as if you had 1 Wealth, but you’re frequently visited by threatening creditors, and shopkeepers often lock their doors when they see you coming.</p>",
