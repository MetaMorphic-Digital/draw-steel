      "value": "<p>When you were young, you almost died in an accident or attack and had a vision of god or saint that showed you the way to save yourself and others you loved. That drove you into the church and gave you a strong belief in a particular religion or cause, and you just can’t wait to tell other people all about it.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a respite activity, you can try to convert members of a community to your cause. Make a Presence test. The Director determines the difficulty based on the community’s receptiveness to your ideas. On a success, you convert one NPC into a follower, in addition to followers you acquire through Renown or other means. The Director determines the type of follower. Once you have converted an NPC into a follower in this way, you can’t try again until you gain a level.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> If you fail in your conversion attempt, one of the followers you have (either through this feature or your Renown) leaves you, their faith in you shaken. If you have no followers, your Renown instead decreases by 1. If you need to reduce your Renown and it is already 0, you instead experience a fitful respite and don’t gain any of the benefits of it.</p>",
