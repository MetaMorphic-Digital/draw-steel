      "value": "<p>You used to flit around the stars in your own ship. But an ugly run-in with a pirate (or a pirate hunter) has left you marooned on this backwater world. You’re prepared to carve out a life here—at least until you can hitch a ride somewhere else. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have the Timescape skill (from the lore skill group). Additionally, you have a power pack that you can activate or deactivate as a maneuver. When you activate the power pack, choose an energy type from cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. Until you deactivate the power pack, your damage-dealing abilities deal that damage type. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You take a bane on any test made to know about anything related to the world where you crash landed.</p>",
