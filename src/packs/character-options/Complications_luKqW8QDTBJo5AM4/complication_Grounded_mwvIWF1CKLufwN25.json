That call was answered by a summoning of protective dirt-and-stone walls, and ever since then, you’ve felt the earth’s presence as a friend and protector. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have the 1st-level Elementalist Specialization feature Motivate Earth (see Chapter 5: Classes). If you also gain this feature in any other way, the Motivate Earth ability becomes a ranged ability for you with a distance of ranged 5.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You attract lightning. Whenever any creature within 2 squares of you takes lightning damage, you take [[/damage 5 lightning]] damage that can’t be reduced in any way.</p>",
