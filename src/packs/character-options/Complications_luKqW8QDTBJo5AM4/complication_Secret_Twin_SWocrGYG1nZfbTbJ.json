      "value": "<p>You have an identical twin - either a sibling or someone who looks so much like you that none would ever know the difference. They had a life that you coveted, or they had obligations that couldn’t go unfulfilled. So when they went missing, you stepped in and started living their life. Most folks are none the wiser.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You claimed something that belonged to your twin as your own - a signature treasure that is now all yours. You gain a 1st echelon trinket of your choice. This treasure has their name or sigil written, sewn, or emblazoned on it somewhere.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your twin disappeared for a reason - someone wanted them dead. Whenever you finish a respite, roll a d10. On a result of 1 or 2, the Director can decide that your past catches up with you at any point in the future in the form of an assassin or someone who knows your real identity and threatens to reveal it as part of a blackmail scheme.</p>",
