But luck is fickle—and when you don’t trust it, it deserts you. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you spend a hero token to succeed on a saving throw or to reroll a test, roll a [[/r d10]]. On a 6 or higher, you gain the benefit but don’t spend the hero token. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever you obtain a tier 1 outcome on a test and don’t spend a hero token to reroll, you take a bane on the next test you make.</p>",
