The flame that now burns in your soul can sear your enemies—or you if you fall short of expectations. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you fight on behalf of your special purpose, whenever you obtain a tier 3 outcome with a damage-dealing ability, the ability deals extra fire damage equal to your highest characteristic score. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever the Director determines that you act against your purpose or fail to live up to the high standards associated with it, you take [[/damage 5+@level fire]]  damage. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.</p>",
