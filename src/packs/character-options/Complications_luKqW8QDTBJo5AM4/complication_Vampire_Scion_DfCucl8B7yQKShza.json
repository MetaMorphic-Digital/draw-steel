      "value": "<p>A vampire has bitten you. You’re not undead—or not yet, anyway—but your connection with your vampire progenitor fills you with urges you fight to control. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you make a melee free strike against an adjacent creature, you can do so by biting that creature. If you obtain a tier 3 outcome on the free strike, you gain temporary Stamina equal to the damage dealt. If not lost beforehand, this temporary Stamina lasts until the end of your next respite. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While you have temporary Stamina from this complication, you grow visible fangs, you take a bane on Presence tests made to interact with humanoids, and your vampire progenitor can sense your location.</p>",
