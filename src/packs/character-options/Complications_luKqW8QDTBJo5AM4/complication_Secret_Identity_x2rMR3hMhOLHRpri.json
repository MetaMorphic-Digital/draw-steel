      "value": "<p>You’re secretly very important - but it’s not safe for your true identity to be known. Perhaps you’re the witness to a crime or a royal on the run from a usurper. Until the appropriate villains are punished, you’ll maintain the guise of an ordinary adventurer.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can resume your true identity, either temporarily or permanently. While in your true identity, your Renown and Wealth are treated as 2 higher, along with any other benefits you may gain from your identity.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You have powerful and clever enemies. Until they’re defeated, if you resume your true identity, there is a cumulative 20% chance that they find you and confront you each day. This chance resets if you resume your secret identity for a full day. Even if you try to keep your identity hidden, their suspicions may be raised by a careless slip.</p>",
