      "value": "<p>Your mother and father never saw eye to eye - you know that because your father’s still alive. Your mother was a medusa. It made your childhood difficult, and now it’s making your adulthood complicated as well.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> These looks don’t kill - they petrify.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Out of combat, you use Stone Eyes on anyone who meets your eye, whether you intend to or not. Your companions know not to make eye contact, but strangers are likely to trigger the ability unless you cover your eyes.</p>",
