They’re supremely competent, of course, but they sometimes seem to forget who’s in charge.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have a retainer, in addition to any followers you acquire through Renown or other means. As usual, you can have only one retainer in your service at a time.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Outside of combat, your retainer is under the Director’s control. The retainer sometimes acts without orders—always with your best interests at heart, but often in embarrassing or inconvenient ways.</p>",
