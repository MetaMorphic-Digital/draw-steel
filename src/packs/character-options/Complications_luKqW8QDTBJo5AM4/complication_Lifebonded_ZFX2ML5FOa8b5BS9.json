      "value": "<p>In a sinister ritual, your soul has been bound to that of another creature. This might be a companion, a creature you are beholden to, or an enemy. When they die, you die—making you the perfect bodyguard. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose another creature who doesn’t have the Lifebonded complication. When you die, your body disappears until that creature finishes a respite or earns 1 or more Victories. You then appear next to the creature, fully healed. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> If the creature you’re bound to dies, you die as well, no matter what other traits or features you have.</p>",
