      "value": "<p>You have a piratical past (and maybe a piratical present and future as well). While you’re not well known ashore, other pirates have a way of recognizing their own.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When interacting with pirates or pirate hunters, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual. Additionally, you hold a piece of a pirate map. Somewhere in the world, a handful of other pirates hold the other pieces of the map. With all the pieces, you’d know the location of a fabulous pirate treasure.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> The pirate treasure is said to be cursed or haunted. Furthermore, you’re not the only ones looking for it. The pirates holding the other pieces of the map would very much like to get their hands on your piece!</p>",
