      "value": "<p>You occasionally hear a voice in your head, offering orders or advice. You don’t know who the voice is or why, but when you’ve followed the advice, it’s usually proved to be sound.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The Director tells you when you hear the voice. The voice seems to be aware of your surroundings, and its advice is usually vague but helpful. Someday its motivations might be different from your own, but for now it seems keen on making sure that you survive.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Eventually, the voice may reveal that it wants something from you - something you may or may not want to provide. If the voice is displeased with you, it can prevent you from resting during a respite, causing you to regain 2 fewer Recoveries than normal.</p>",
