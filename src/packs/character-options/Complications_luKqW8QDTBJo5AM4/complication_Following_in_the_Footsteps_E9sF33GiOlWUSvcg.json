From studying the many heroic tales told of them, you hope to someday learn your idol’s most famous battle technique. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a heroic ability for your class of a higher level than you currently are. When you take this ability in future, its Heroic Resource cost is permanently reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 1). </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> In your quest for advanced techniques, you have neglected the basics. Choose a heroic ability you already know. That ability’s Heroic Resource cost is permanently increased by 1.</p>",
