      "value": "<p>Before you were a hero, you were a chef - and when you retire, you have big plans for your next restaurant or inn. In the meantime, you’re on the lookout for rare ingredients that only a traveler can find. After all, it’s food that makes the world go round.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you complete a respite or wake up after a night’s sleep, you can spend 1 uninterrupted hour prepare an excellent meal for up to 10 creatures, provided you have ingredients and cooking tools. Each creature that eats the meal gains 1 bonus Recovery, which expires at the end of the day if not used.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> The first time each day that you are forced to eat ordinary or substandard food, you lose 2 Recoveries.</p>",
