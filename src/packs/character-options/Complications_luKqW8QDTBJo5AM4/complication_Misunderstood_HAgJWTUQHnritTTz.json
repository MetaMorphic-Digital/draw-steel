It’s no wonder that you usually wear a hood.</p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> When you reveal your appearance to creatures that don’t know you personally, you gain an edge on tests where the Brag or Intimidate skill could be applied and a bane on tests where the Flirt, Lead, or Persuade skills could be applied.</p>",
