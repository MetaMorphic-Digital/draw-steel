It’s no wonder you usually wear a hood. </p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> When you reveal your appearance to creatures who don’t know you personally, you gain an edge on any test involving those creatures where the Brag or Intimidate skill could be applied, but you take a bane on any test where the Flirt, Lead, or Persuade skill could be applied.</p>",
