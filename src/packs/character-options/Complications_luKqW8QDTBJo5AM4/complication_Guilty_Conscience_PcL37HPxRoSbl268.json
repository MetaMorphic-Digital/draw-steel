      "value": "<p>The world is in trouble—and it’s partly your fault. Maybe you helped a villain rise to power or inadvertently released a demon from imprison- ment. Now it’s your mission to repair the damage you caused. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You’re determined to stay alive so you can set things right. When your Stamina reaches the negative of your winded value, you can use a free triggered action to spend a Recovery. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Many people blame you for the evils you caused. They might be unfriendly or hostile to you—and you can understand their point of view. You take a bane on any test made to interact with those who know what you did, and on strikes made against such creatures.</p>",
