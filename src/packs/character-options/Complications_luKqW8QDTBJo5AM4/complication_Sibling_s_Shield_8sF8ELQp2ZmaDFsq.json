      "value": "<p>You were tasked with delivering a ceremonial shield to your older sibling, a celebrated warrior, for their years of service. When you arrived at their homestead, you found them dead on their doorstep with their sword lodged in their back. If you were going to find out who did this to them and why, you needed to step into their shoes. It will take a while to match up to your sibling’s legacy, though.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You cannot be flanked as long as you wear your sibling’s shield on your back.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Visions of your dead sibling haunt you at night. Whenever you take a respite, make an Intuition test without applying a skill. On a 17 or lower or lower, you gain 1 fewer Recoveries than your normally would when the respite ends.</p>",
