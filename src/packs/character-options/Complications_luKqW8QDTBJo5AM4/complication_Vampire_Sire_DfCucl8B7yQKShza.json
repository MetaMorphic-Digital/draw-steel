      "value": "<p>A vampire has bitten you. You’re not undead - not yet anyway - but you have a connection with your vampire sire, and you feel urges you fight to control.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you make a melee free strike against an adjacent creature, you can make it a bite. If you do so, you gain temporary Stamina equal to the damage you dealt. This temporary Stamina lasts until the end of your next respite if it doesn’t disappear due to damage.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While you have temporary Stamina from this complication, your vampire sire can sense your location, you grow visible fangs, and you have a bane on Presence tests made to interact with humanoids who aren’t undead.</p>",
