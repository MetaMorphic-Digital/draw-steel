And sure, you’re always imagining the many horrible ways you could die, but you’re used to fear. When you run in terror, you run toward the enemy. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you are frightened, you can move toward the source of your fear. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever you make a saving throw to end the frightened condition, you roll a d10 twice and take the lower roll.</p>",
