Whether by choice or by accident, you wound up helping one faction at the expense of the other. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Having gained the favor of the faction you helped, you can call on its members three times for favors. If a favor is reasonable and within the faction’s power to grant, its members do it, no questions asked. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> The faction you wronged hates you, and its members would love to see you pay for your transgression.</p>",
