After all, if youâ€™re saving the world, who can be mad at you for stealing a few coins along the way? </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have one skill of your choice from the intrigue skill group. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever you meet an NPC for the first time, the Director can decide that NPC was a victim of one of your previous cons and remembers you. If they do so, the party gains a hero token.</p>",
