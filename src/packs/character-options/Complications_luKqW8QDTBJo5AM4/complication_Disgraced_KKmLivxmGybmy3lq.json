      "value": "<p>You’re a disgraced member of a powerful family or guild, having been turned out by your relatives or peers. Those you were once close to won’t give you the time of day anymore, much less lend a helping hand, until you clear your name or clean up your act. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You earn 1 Renown, and you have one skill of your choice from the interpersonal or intrigue skill group. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Anyone who has heard of you and is influenced by your Renown treats you as infamous. Whenever you are part of a negotiation with an NPC who has an interest of 2 or lower, that NPC makes a plan to hurt you personally after the negotiation ends—and carries that plan out.</p>",
