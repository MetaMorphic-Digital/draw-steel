You’re expected to carry on the family business—but who can settle down to a boring job when adventure calls! That’s why you ran away. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have one skill of your choice from the crafting skill group. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Members of your extended family are looking for you, intending to drag you home—and you’ve never been able to stand up to them.</p>",
