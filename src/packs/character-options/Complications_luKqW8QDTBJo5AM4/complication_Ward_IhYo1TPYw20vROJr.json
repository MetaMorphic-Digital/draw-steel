      "value": "<p>Your childhood sweetheart was royalty, and the two of you stayed close throughout the years. When your former sweetheart died, you swore an oath to dedicate your life to become a role model for their child, advising them in the ways of being a benevolent monarch. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You know how to talk to monarchs, aristocrats, and other wealthy leaders. When you engage with any such NPC during a negotiation, their patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Your royal ward can be a burden. Whenever you take a respite, roll a [[/r d10]]. On a 1, your ward contacts you and requires your help during the respite, requiring you to spend your time helping them instead of undertaking a respite activity.</p>",
