      "value": "<p>You were brought up to a strict standard of behavior. You cannot tell a lie.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you don’t lie, you gain the benefit of the Censor’s A Sense for Truth Order feature. If you also gain the A Sense for Truth feature in another way, you also gain a double edge on tests made to persuade a creature of a specific fact.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you lie, your honor is stained, and you gain a bane on any test you make that uses a skill from the interpersonal skill group and lose this complication’s benefit. You can lose the bane and regain this complication’s benefit only by doing penance, such as gaining the forgiveness of the creature you lied to.</p>",
