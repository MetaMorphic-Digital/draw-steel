      "value": "<p>You’ve always been a lone wolf. With no one else to lean on, you’ve picked up a million survival tricks. Which made it all the more surprising when you joined your current adventuring group, and found the family you never had.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you complete a respite, choose a skill you don’t possess. You gain the benefits of that skill until you next complete a respite.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Now that you finally have people who care about you, you won’t let anyone take them away! When a creature reduces one of your allies to 0 Stamina, you are taunted by the creature until your ally’s Stamina is higher than 0, the end of the encounter, or another creature makes you taunted.</p>",
