      "value": "<p>You’ve always been a lone wolf. With no one else to lean on, you’ve picked up a million survival tricks. Which made it all the more surprising when you joined your current adventuring group and found the family you’d never known you needed. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you finish a respite, choose a skill you don’t have. You have that skill until the end of your next respite. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Now that you finally have people who care about you, you won’t let anyone take them away! Whenever a creature reduces one of your allies to 0 Stamina, you are taunted by that creature until your ally’s Stamina is higher than 0, another creature makes you taunted, or the end of the encounter.</p>",
