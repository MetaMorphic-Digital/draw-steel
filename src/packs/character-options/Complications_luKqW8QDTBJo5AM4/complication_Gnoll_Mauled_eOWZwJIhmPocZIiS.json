      "value": "<p>As a child, you survived a gnoll attack. But that attack left you with a jagged scar and the occasional fit of bloodlust. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever an ally within 5 squares is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a triggered action to move up to your speed and make a free strike. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> While you are dazed, if you start your turn adjacent to one or more creatures, you must use your main action to make a melee free strike against an adjacent creature. </p><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can’t take this complication if you can’t be made dazed.</p>",
