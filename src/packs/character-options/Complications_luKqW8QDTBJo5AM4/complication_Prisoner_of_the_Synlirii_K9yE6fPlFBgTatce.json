You escaped them, but you can’t escape that feeling in the back of your mind - the feeling of being watched.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can telepathically communicate with creatures within 10 of you if they share a language with you and you know of each other. The receiver of your telepathic communications can choose to respond telepathically.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Voiceless talkers within 1 mile know your location and can overhear and understand your telepathic conversations.</p>",
