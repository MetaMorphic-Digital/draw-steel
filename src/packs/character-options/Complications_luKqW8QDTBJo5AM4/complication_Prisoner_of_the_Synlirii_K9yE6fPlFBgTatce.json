You escaped them, but you can’t escape a feeling that’s lingered since then in the back of your mind—the feeling of being watched. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can telepathically communicate with any creature within 10 squares of you if they share a language with you and you know of each other. A creature you communicate with this way can respond telepathically if they choose. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Any voiceless talker within 1 mile knows your location, and can overhear and understand your telepathic conversations.</p>",
