      "value": "<p>Perhaps the stars marked you out at birth, or maybe your name appears in an ancient prophecy. In any case, a sinister cult has decided that you’re important to their plans—though you don’t particularly like the fate those plans have in store for you. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have 3 destiny points. Whenever you spend your Heroic Resource for your class, you can spend 1 or more destiny points instead. Each time you earn a Victory, you regain 1 destiny point. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever you spend 1 or more destiny points, you take [[/damage 1d10 psychic]] damage that can’t be reduced in any way, and the cult that seeks you becomes aware of your location.</p>",
