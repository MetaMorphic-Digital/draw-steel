It wasn’t until you got caught by an elementalist who blasted you with thunder that you learned the enhanced hearing had some nasty side effects.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can silently communicate with any creature, provided you share a language and can see each other.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Sonic Weakness + 5</p>",
