If youâ€™re not careful, it actually does explode, radiating psychic waves that harm friends and enemies alike.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Psionic energy bursts from your body in an iridescent shimmer.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> When you gain the bleeding, frightened, or weakened condition, you must use Psychic Blast as a free triggered action.</p>",
