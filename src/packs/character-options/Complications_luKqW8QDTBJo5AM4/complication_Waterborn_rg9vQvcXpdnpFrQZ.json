      "value": "<p>You nearly lost your life at sea, but then you heard the voice. Someone … something in the sea called out to you - telling you to swim. Suddenly the ocean wasn’t your doom. It was your parent, birthing you into something new. You emerge with a small piece of the ocean’s power. For what purpose - you can’t be sure.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your movement gains the Swim tag, and you can breathe underwater.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Lightning Weakness + 5</p>",
