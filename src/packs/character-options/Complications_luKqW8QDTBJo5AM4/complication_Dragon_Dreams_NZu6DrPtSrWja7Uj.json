You haven’t told anyone about these dreams, except for your one strange relative who seems to know more than they’re letting on.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose 2 ancestry points’ worth of purchased dragon knight traits (see Chapter 3: Ancestries). You can use these traits whenever you have 5 or more Victories.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Whenever you are reduced to 0 Stamina, you explode with heat and fire. You and each creature within 5 squares of you takes [[/damage 2*@level fire]]{fire damage} equal to twice your level. You can’t reduce this damage for yourself in any way.</p>",
