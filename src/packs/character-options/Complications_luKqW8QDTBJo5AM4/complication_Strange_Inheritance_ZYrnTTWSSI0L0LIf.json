It only works while the total of your level plus your Victories is 5 or higher. You don’t learn what the item’s powers are until the first time it becomes operative.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> With no other inheritance, you accumulated debts. The first time your Wealth exceeds 1, you lose 1 Wealth.</p>",
