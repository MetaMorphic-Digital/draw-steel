      "value": "<p>Your homeland has been corrupted by some terrible monster, and you’re the only one who escaped the plague. The rest of your family still exists, but in changed forms - perhaps as vampires or zombies. People tell you the situation is hopeless, but you’re determined to find a cure.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a type of monster, such as medusa or vampire. You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws and to characteristic scores for the purpose of resisting potencies against this monster’s abilities.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You have started to turn into one of these creatures yourself. If you don’t find a cure soon … you’ll fall victim to the disease or curse. Work with your Director to determine the timeline of your disease taking effect. It should be something that could happen during the campaign!</p>",
