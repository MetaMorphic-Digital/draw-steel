Whenever you take a respite, make a Reason test to determine whether you gain this complicationâ€™s benefit or drawback. </p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> With a tier 2 outcome, you experience a vision of an event currently happening in your world. The vision lasts for only a few seconds, but the information you glean is helpful to you. With a tier 3 outcome, the vision lasts for 1 minute or more. </p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> With a tier 1 outcome, you receive a painful vision that is fractal and inscrutable. When you finish the respite, you lose 1 Recovery.</p>",
