      "value": "<p>You were orphaned or lost in the wild, and a friendly animal pack (perhaps apes, bears, or wolves) took you in. Returning to so-called civilization was a shock, but you’re determined to learn all you can about your own kind.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose an animal type, such as wolf. You can communicate with this animal as if you shared a language, and animals of this type are not initially hostile to you unless they’re supernaturally compelled to be. You gain an edge when you use Handle Animals to interact with this animal.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> You don’t have a culture, though you can still speak Caelian.</p>",
