What you lost in polish and tactical acumen you make up for in raw power.</p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> At the start of your turn during combat, you can forgo gaining heroic resources until the start of your next turn. If you do, until the start of your next turn your strikes deal additional damage equal to your highest characteristic score.</p>",
