What you lost in polish and tactical acumen, you now make up for in raw power. </p><p><strong>Benefit and Drawback:</strong> At the start of each of your turns during combat, you can forgo gaining your Heroic Resource until the start of your next turn. If you do, your strikes gain a damage bonus equal to your highest characteristic score until the start of your next turn.</p>",
