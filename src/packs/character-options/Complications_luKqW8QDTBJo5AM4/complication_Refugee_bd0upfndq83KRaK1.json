      "value": "<p>A hostile army - perhaps the forces of Ajax, the Iron Saint - conquered your homeland. Your family escaped, but you can’t return home until your oppressors are defeated once and for all.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When your family fled your homeland, they left their greatest treasure behind. Work with the Director to determine its nature. It might be a trinket or leveled item, several points of Wealth, a treasure’s project source, or the like. This treasure is now in the hands of the invaders, until you win it back and use it against them.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> The faction that invaded your homeland is hostile to you.</p>",
