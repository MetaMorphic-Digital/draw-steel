      "value": "<p>You’re quick to anger, and some even say you’re possessed by a literal spirit of wrath. You never let an insult go without slinging one right back. In combat, things are similar: no matter the tactical circumstances, when someone injures you, you feel compelled to answer blood with blood.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you are taunted by a creature, you gain an edge on attacks against that creature. If you have the Rage heroic resource, you can spend 1 rage to make it a double edge.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> In conversation or negotiation, when a creature insults you, you must either spend a Recovery or reply with an insult. Furthermore, in combat, whenever a creature hits you with an strike while you are not taunted, you are taunted (EoT) by that creature.</p>",
