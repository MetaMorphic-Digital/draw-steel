Normally, being beheaded by one of these giants is fatal, but due to your latent psionic ability you’re able to survive despite your decapitation.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You don’t have a head but can psionically borrow another.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Having no head, you can’t see, hear, smell, or taste except by using the Share Head ability. Additionally, you can’t wear gear that requires a head, such as helmets or hats.</p>",
