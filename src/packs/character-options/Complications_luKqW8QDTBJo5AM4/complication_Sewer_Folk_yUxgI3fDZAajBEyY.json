There you learned lessons that have stood you well, although the miasma of the sewers did permanent damage to your health.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your movement gains either the Climb or Swim keyword (your choice). Additionally, while in a city you and your companions can move from place to place without being detected, and you never get lost while underground.</p><p><strong>Drawback:</strong> Poison Weakness + 5</p>",
