Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies: </p><p><strong>Clear</strong>: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.</p><p><strong>Foggy</strong>: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill. </p><p><strong>Overcast</strong>: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.</p><p><strong>Precipitation</strong>: When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill. </p><p>If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.</p>",
