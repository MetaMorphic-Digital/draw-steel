You can spend virtue on your abilities as if it were wrath.</p><p>Additionally, you can spend 3 virtue to access one of your deity’s domains that you usually don’t have access to. When you do, you can use that domain’s features until you finish another respite. Virtue remains until you spend it.</p>",
