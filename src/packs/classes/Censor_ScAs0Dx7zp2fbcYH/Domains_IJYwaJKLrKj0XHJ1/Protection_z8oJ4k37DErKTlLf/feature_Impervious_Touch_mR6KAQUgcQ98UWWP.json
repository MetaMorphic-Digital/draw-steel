You can maintain this spell on a number of objects equal to [[lookup @P]]{your Presence score}, and you can end the spell on any object at any time (no action required).</p><p>Additionally, you can place this spell on a building or vehicle (or a similar structure with the Director’s approval) that is of a size larger than [[lookup @P]]{your Presence score}. You can place the spell on only one such target at a time, and you can maintain the spell on a larger target and a number of objects equal to [[lookup @P]]{your Presence score} simultaneously.</p>",
