      "value": "<p>Lightning and thunder infuse your body. Whenever you use an ability to deal rolled damage to another creature, the ability deals extra lightning damage equal to [[lookup @P]]{your Presence score}. Additionally, if you use an ability that force moves a creature, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to [[lookup @P]]{your Presence score}. While you are under the effect of your Windwalk feature, lightning enhances your locomotion to grant you a bonus to speed equal to [[lookup @M]]{your Might score}. If Windwalk already grants you a bonus to speed, this bonus adds to that.</p>",
