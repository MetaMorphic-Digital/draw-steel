      "value": "<p>With this stormwight kit, you channel your primordial ferocity into the form of a crow, becoming stealthy and quick. Corven are tied to the mountain passes and the hot winds that flow through them. This aspect is associated with the warm and fast-rising anabatic wind.</p><h3>Aspect Benefits</h3><p>You gain an edge on tests made to hide and sneak. Additionally, whenever you fall, you can use a free triggered action to use your Aspect of the Wild ability.</p><h3>Animal Form: Crow</h3><p>While you are in your crow form, your size is 1T and you can fly. You can use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver, and you can use your allies as cover when you hide. You canâ€™t use any abilities while in this form except for Aspect of the Wild.</p><h3>Hybrid Form: Crow</h3><p>While you are in your hybrid form, your size is your choice of 1S or 1M. At 4th level, you can fly.</p><h3>Primordial Storm: Anabatic Wind</h3><p>Your primordial damage type is fire.</p><h1>Corven Growing Ferocity</h1><p>As your ferocity grows, you gain benefits as noted on the Corven Growing Ferocity table.
