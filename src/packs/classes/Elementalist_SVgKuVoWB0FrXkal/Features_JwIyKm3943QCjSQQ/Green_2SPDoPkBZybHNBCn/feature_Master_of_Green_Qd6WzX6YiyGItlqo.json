      "value": "<p>The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies’ additional Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.</p><p>Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce [[/roll 1d6]] of a treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an existing tree to produce another [[/roll 1d6]] Life Fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.</p><p>As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their aging pauses for [[/roll 1d10]] years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don’t stack. Instead, the creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for the longest time.</p>",
