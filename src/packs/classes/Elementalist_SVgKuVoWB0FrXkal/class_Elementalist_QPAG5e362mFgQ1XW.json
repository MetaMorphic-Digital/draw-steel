      "value": "<p>A ir for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mysteryâ€” that which cannot be known. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic. As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, debilitate enemies, ward yourself and allies, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your elemental specialization determines which of these talents you excel at.</p>",
