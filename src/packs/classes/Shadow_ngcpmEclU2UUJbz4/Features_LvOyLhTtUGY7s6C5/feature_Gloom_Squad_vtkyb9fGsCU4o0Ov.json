      "value": "<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to create [[/roll 1d6]] clones of yourself in unoccupied adjacent spaces. A clone acts on your turn and uses your statistics, except they have 1 Stamina. They are affected by any conditions and effects on you, and last until the start of your next turn. A clone doesn’t have insight and can’t use the Careful Observation ability, the Umbral Form feature, or any triggered actions. On their turn, a clone has a move action, a maneuver, and a main action that they can use only to make a free strike. While making a free strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren’t also striking.</p><p>Outside of combat, you can have one clone active for every 2 Victories you have. If a clone is destroyed, you must wait 1 hour before creating another one.</p>",
