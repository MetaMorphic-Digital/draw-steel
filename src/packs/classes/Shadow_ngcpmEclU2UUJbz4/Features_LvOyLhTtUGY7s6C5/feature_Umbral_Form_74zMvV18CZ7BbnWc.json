      "value": "<p>As a maneuver, you lose control of yourself, becoming a shadow creature dripping with ash. This transformation lasts until the end of the encounter, until you are dying, or after 1 uninterrupted hour of quiet focus outside of combat. You gain the following effects while in this form: </p><p>¥ You can automatically climb at full speed while moving. </p><p>¥ Enemies’ spaces don’t count as difficult terrain for you. An enemy takes corruption damage equal to your Agility score the first time you pass through their space on a turn. </p><p>¥ If you end your turn with cover or concealment from another creature, you are automatically hidden from that creature. </p><p>¥ You gain 1 surge at the start of each of your turns. </p><p>¥ You have corruption immunity equal to 5 + your level. </p><p>¥ Creatures gain an edge on strikes against you. </p><p>¥ You take a bane on Presence tests made to interact with other creatures.</p>",
