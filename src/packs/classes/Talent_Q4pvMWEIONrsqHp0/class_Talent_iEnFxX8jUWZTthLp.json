      "value": "<p>A rare few people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, a significant event that activates a talent’s abilities, can tap into the mind’s full potential. You are one of those people—a master of psionics and a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. You can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature’s mind. As a talent, you are limited only by the strength of your mind. But the ability to wield multiple powers at once and change reality at will involves a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming you, and talents who use too much power too quickly pay a deadly price. </p>",
