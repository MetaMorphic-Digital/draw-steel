You can spend vision on your abilities as if it were clarity. </p><p>Additionally, you can spend vision to use one additional psionic ability on your turn, provided you pay the entire cost of the ability in vision. If you choose to use a psionic ability that usually costs no clarity, you must spend 1 vision to use it. </p><p>Vision remains until you spend it.</p>",
