You can spend command on your abilities as if it were focus.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to increase the power roll outcome for that target by one tier. Whenever an enemy marked by you makes an ability roll, you can spend 1 command as a free triggered action to decrease the power roll outcome by one tier.</p><p>Command remains until you spend it.</p>",
