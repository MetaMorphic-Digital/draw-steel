At the start of an encounter, you can use a free triggered action to use your Mark ability against an enemy you have line of effect to, even if you are surprised. You can then immediately slide the marked target up to 3 squares, ignoring their stability. The target canâ€™t be moved in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.</p>",
