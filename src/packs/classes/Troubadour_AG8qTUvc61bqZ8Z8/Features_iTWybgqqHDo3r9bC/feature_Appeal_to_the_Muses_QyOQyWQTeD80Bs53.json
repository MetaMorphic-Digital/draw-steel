      "value": "<p>You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows’ spirits, appealing to the muses to heighten a battle’s drama. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain to achieve the same end.</p><p>Before you roll to gain drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:</p><ul><li><p>If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director gains 1d3 Malice.</p></li><li><p>If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep or give to an ally within the distance of your active performance. The Director gains 1 Malice.</p></li><li><p>If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 of a Heroic Resource, which you can distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your active performance.</p></li></ul>",
