Each time you finish a respite, you can shift yourself and any creatures in the area of your Null Field ability to any location in the timescape known to you, known to any other creature in the area, or where any supernatural treasure in the area has been before. </p><p>Whenever you use an ability, you gain 1 discipline that can be used only to apply a benefit from your Psi Boost feature to that ability. Additionally, you and allies in the area of your Null Field ability ignore banes and double banes on your power rolls.</p>",
