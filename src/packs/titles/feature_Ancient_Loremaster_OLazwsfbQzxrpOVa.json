The Director chooses the type of person who would value this secret—usually a member of a particular faction, such as a Higaran noble, or a type of person, such as a fence of stolen goods. When engaged in a negotiation with this type of person, you can offer this secret. If they accept, their interest increases by 3 (to a maximum of 5). You can share this secret only once.</p><p><em>Rare Books:</em> You add rare, ancient books to your collection. Whenever you undertake a research project, roll [[/roll 1d6]] for each dead language you know and add the total to the project roll.</p><p><em>Susurrus Codex:</em> You find a sinister book that whispers advice in a voice no one else can hear. As long as you follow the book’s advice, you gain an edge on Reason tests and take a bane on Presence tests. You can stop following the book’s advice at any time, but the book won’t speak to you for the rest of the day.</p>",
