      "value": "<p>The original servitor species of the synliroi—evil psions with near godlike power—the kuran'zoi liberated themselves during the First Psychic War. In the centuries since, they built their own culture and civilization as nomads of the timescape. The exonym “time raiders” was given to them by denizens of the lower worlds who, seeing the advanced technology the kuran’zoi wield, concluded they must be from the future.</p><p>Extraordinarily rare in Orden, time raiders thrive on the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, where the winds of limbo roar.</p><p>In place of eyes, kuran’zoi possess crystalline ocular sensors that grant them high-spectral vision and which are hardened against the extreme radiations encountered in the Sea of Stars, permitting them to operate freely outside their vessels with only their portable rebreathers. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran’zoi is like a squad unto themself.</p><h4>Time Raider Traits</h4><p>Time Raider heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.3va7ie8M9HbPtSIe]{Psychic Scar}</p><h4>Purchased Time Raider Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
