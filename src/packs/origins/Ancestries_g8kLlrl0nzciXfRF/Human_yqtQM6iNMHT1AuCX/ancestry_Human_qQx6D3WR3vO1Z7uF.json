And the presence of deathless causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Or why do you think graveyards affect you so? Whatever magic is, its grip on you is light. Whatever drives the deathless, your nature rebels against it.</p><p>“No one knows why this should be. We elves have no such senses. Nor do the elementals or the kanin … the dwarves and the orcs as you say. What is it that sets humans apart? I am an historian, not a physician. I cannot say. Perhaps some of you will one day find out and teach us all the reason.”</p><h4>Human Traits</h4><p>Human heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.X40Vg1cP1ze1FeBL]{Detect the Supernatural}</p><h4>Purchased Human Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
