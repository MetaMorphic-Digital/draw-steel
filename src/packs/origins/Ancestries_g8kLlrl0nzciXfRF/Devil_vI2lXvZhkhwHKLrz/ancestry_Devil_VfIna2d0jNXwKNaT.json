      "value": "<p>The native ancestry of the Seven Cities of Hell, devils are humanoids with red or blue skin expressed in a wide variety of hues, from bright crimson to deep purple. Each devil is born with some <em>hellmark</em>—horns, a tail, cloven hooves, a forked tongue, fanged incisors, or even wings.</p><p>Hell is dominated by the Seven Cities of Hell, each ruled by a different archdevil who constantly plots and schemes against the others in the hope of ascending to the Throne of Hell.</p><p>Those devils who join “the trade,” as their civil service is called, spend their days in bureaucratic service hoping or scheming for promotion. Devils looking for a quick path up the bureaucratic ladder sign up for the Exchange, whereby mortals in the mundane world who perform the right rituals can summon a devil, who bargains with the supplicant on behalf of their archdevil. Archdevils can grant temporary worldly power in exchange for a supplicant’s soul, with the summoned devil acting as the broker.</p><p>On rare occasions, though, the summoning goes wrong and the supplicant dies before the deal can be struck, stranding the summoned devil on Orden permanently. Some stranded devils seek to return to Hell, but most prefer life in Orden, where the phrase “stabbed in the back by a colleague” is usually a metaphor.</p><p>The majority of devils in Orden are not from, nor have ever been to, the Seven Cities. They are descendants of devils who were stranded in the mundane world decades, centuries, even millennia ago.</p><p></p><h4>Devil Traits</h4><p>Devil heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p></p><p>Signature Trait: @UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.Ch6TwaIZ8MxXYzbn]{Silver Tongue}</p><p></p><h4>Purchased Devil Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
