      "value": "<p>An anger that cannot be hidden. A fury that drives them in battle. Orcs are famed throughout the world as consummate warriors—a reputation that the peace-loving orcs find distasteful.</p><p>The fifth of the speaking peoples, orcs arrived on Orden after humans and elves. They made their homes in the borderlands between those two cultures, preferring the natural forests and avoiding the elf-haunted wodes. For generations, this put them directly in the path of humans who cut down the trees and built roads and farms.</p><p>Each orc has within them a fire that causes their veins to glow once blood is drawn. This anger propels them right to the edge of death. The dichotomy between their desire to be left alone and their zeal in battle is summarized in a dwarf proverb:</p><p>“Be thankful orcs do not hold grudges.”</p><h4>Orc Traits</h4><p>Orc heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.AL0IjPuMhACpsiks]{Relentless}</p><h4>Purchased Orc Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
