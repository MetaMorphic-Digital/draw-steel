They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.</p><p>Dwarves are the children of the elder god Ord, and a common phrase among dwarves is “Ord made the world”—their way of saying, “What will be, will be.” They take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord’s name.</p><h4>Dwarf Traits</h4><p>Dwarf heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.7UBJoBRNKS0DseiW]{Runic Carving}</p><h4>Purchased Dwarf Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
