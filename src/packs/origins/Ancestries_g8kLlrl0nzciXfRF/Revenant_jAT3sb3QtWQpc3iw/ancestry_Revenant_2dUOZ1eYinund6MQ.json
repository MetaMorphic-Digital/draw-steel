      "value": "<p>The dead walk among us. Some of them are happier about it than others.</p><p>Unlike the necromantic rituals that produce wights and wraiths and zombies, revenants rise from the grave through a combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for vengeance. Creatures sustained on pure will, they have no need of food or water or airâ€”and, unlike their zombified cousins, they retain all their memories and personality from life.</p><p>These revenants are rare. Many are hunted by ignorant villagers who see only their dead flesh and assume the worst. Those who survive the pitchfork brigade either choose a solitary life, often as a wandering soul seeking out living company yet constantly in fear of it, or they migrate to a metropolis such as Blackbottom or Capital, where lost souls gather to make a home.</p><h4>Revenant Traits</h4><p>Revenant heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.xXl9h7qyi4z91jYO]{Former Life}</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.S2OsBBFHqBoHZYUu]{Tough But Withered}</p><h4>Purchased Revenant Traits</h4><p>You have 2 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
