      "value": "<p>In spite of their friendly, outgoing nature, the rare presence of a hakaan in human society is considered a harbinger. An omen of dark times.</p><p>Descended from a tribe of giants in upper Vanigar, the original Haka’an tribe made a bargain with Holkatya the Vanigar trickster god. They traded some of their gigantic size and strength for the ability to see the future.</p><p>But Holkatya betrayed them, and the only future a hakaan is allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death. These visions are never of some mundane tragedy. No hakaan ever received a vision of dying from choking on a grape. This Doomsight is always momentous. Always dramatic.</p><p>The Doomsight can happen at any moment. It does not come for all or even most hakaan, but when it comes, it is considered an act of overwhelming hubris to ignore it. Trying to escape the Doomsight means a painful, tragic death, and cursing your family to live with shame.</p><p>But the only hakaan the average human meets is one trying to fulfill their doom. The human superstition—that the arrival of one or more hakaan in human lands is a sign of great forces acting in the world, auspicious times—is literally true. In dark times, many hakaan experience the Doomsight and leave their communities to venture out into the mundane world, in search of their destiny.</p><p>Humans in Vanigar have their own word for this concept of a personal fate. “Wyrd.” Traditional hakaan sometimes refer to the Doomsight as “wyrdken.”</p><h4>Hakaan Traits</h4><p>Hakaan heroes have access to the following traits.</p><p>Signature Trait:@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.origins.Item.Z029RWPeRo8KBXQd]{Big!}</p><h4>Purchased Hakaan Traits</h4><p>You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits.
