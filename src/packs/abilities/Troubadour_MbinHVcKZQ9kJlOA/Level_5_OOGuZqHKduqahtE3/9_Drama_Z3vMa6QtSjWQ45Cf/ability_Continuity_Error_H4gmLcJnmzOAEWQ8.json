If the target is a creature, this creates a new creature under the Director’s control. Each entity has half the original target’s Stamina, is [[/apply weakened]], and takes [[/damage 1d6 type=corruption]] damage at the start of each of their turns. If either entity is reduced to 0 Stamina, the other entity persists as the original entity and this effect ends. The effect also ends if both entities occupy the same space, causing them to automatically merge and combine their current Stamina.</p>",
