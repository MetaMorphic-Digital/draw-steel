If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.</p><p>At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more por tals are present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemyâ€™s destination portal.</p>",
