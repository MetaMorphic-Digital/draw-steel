While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, you ignore difficult terrain and reduce the potency of enemy effects targeting you by 1 for you. You can also use a free triggered action at the start of each of your turns to end one effect on you that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn. Each ally in the area also gains these benefits.</p>",
