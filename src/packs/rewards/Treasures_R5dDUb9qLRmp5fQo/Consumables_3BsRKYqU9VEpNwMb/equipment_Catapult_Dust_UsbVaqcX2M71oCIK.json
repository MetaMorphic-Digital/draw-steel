      "value": "<p>Catapult Dust was developed as a cost-effective magic siege weapon. As a main action, you pour the dust out in an adjacent unoccupied space to fill an area as large as a 2 cube.</p><p>At the start of your next turn, the ground at the bottom of the area erupts violently upwards and in a direction of your choice. Any unattended objects in the area, or creatures who have entered the area since the dust was poured, are launched in an arc that is [[/roll 6 + 1d6]] squares long and 3 + [[/roll 3 + 1d6]] squares high.</p>",
