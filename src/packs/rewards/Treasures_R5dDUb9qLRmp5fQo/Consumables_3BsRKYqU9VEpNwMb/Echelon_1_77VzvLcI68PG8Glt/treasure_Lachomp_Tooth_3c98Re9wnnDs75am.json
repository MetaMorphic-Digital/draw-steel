      "value": "<p><em>A thumb-sized serrated tooth manages to scratch your flesh in some way whenever it is handled.</em></p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> As a maneuver, you attach a lachomp tooth to a weapon, allowing that weapon to supernaturally flicker in and out of reality. Your next strike that uses the weapon can tear through multiple targets in a line (for a ranged strike) or surrounding you (for a melee strike). The strike adds the following effects to the tier outcomes of the power roll:</p><ul><li><strong>â‰¤11:</strong> You can affect one additional target with this strike.</li><li><strong>12-16:</strong> You can affect up to three additional targets with this strike.</li><li><strong>17+:</strong> You can affect up to seven additional targets with this strike.</li></ul>",
