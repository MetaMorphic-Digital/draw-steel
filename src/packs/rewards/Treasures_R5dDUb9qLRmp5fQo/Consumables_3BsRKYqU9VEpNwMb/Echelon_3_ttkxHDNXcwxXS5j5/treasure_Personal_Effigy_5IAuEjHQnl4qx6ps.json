While you are within 5 squares of the remains of the creature the effigy is tied to, you can use a maneuver to manually light and burn the effigy and bring the creature back to life. The creature returns to life with Stamina equal to their winded value and [[/heal 10 temp]] that lasts until the end of their next respite. If the creature has been dead for more than 1 minute, they remain dead and the effigy dissolves into dust.</p>",
