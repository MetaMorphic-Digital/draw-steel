Additionally, any damage-dealing weapon ability using the weapon that achieves a tier 3 outcome also leaves the target dazed until the end of their next turn.</p><p><strong>5th Level:</strong> The weapon’s extra psychic damage increases to 2. Additionally, whenever a creature within distance of your ranged weapon free strike uses a triggered action, you can use a triggered action after their triggered action resolves to make a ranged weapon free strike using this weapon against the creature.</p><p><strong>9th Level:</strong> The weapon’s extra psychic damage increases to 3. Additionally, you have a double edge on weapon abilities that use the weapon against creatures who have used a psionic ability since the end of your last turn.</p>",
