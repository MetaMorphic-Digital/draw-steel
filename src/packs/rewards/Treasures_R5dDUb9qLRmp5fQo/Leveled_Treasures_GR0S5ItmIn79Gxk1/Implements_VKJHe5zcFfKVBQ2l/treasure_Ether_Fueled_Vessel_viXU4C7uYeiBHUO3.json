Additionally, whenever you deal rolled damage to a creature using a magic or psionic ability, they become insubstantial to you until the end of their next turn, allowing you to pass through them freely. While insubstantial, a creature can’t make opportunity attacks against you.</p><p><strong>5th Level:</strong> The implement’s damage bonus increases to +2. Additionally, when you move through a creature who is insubstantial to you, you can use a free triggered action to deal damage to them equal to your highest characteristic score. If you do, the insubstantial effect ends immediately after you pass through the creature and into an adjacent space outside them.</p><p><strong>9th Level:</strong> The implement’s damage bonus increases to +3. Additionally, any creature who is insubstantial to you and isn’t a leader or solo creature also can’t make opportunity attacks against your allies while they remain insubstantial.</p>",
