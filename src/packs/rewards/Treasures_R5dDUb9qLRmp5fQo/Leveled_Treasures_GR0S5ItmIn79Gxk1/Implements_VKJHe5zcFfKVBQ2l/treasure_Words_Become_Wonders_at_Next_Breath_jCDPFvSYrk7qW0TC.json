While the tome is open, it floats in an adjacent space and flips to specific pages at your command, you gain an edge on Reason tests made to recall lore, and you gain a +3 bonus to distance for your ranged magic or psionic abilities.</p><p><strong>5th Level:</strong> While the tome is open, the bonus to distance for your ranged magic or psionic abilities increases to +5. Additionally, when you or a creature you have line of effect to uses a magic or psionic ability, you can use a triggered action to grant a +3 bonus to the power roll.</p><p><strong>9th Level:</strong> While the tome is open, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on Reason tests made to recall lore, and when you use a heroic ability, its Heroic Resource cost is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).</p>",
