Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to speed.</p><p><strong>5th Level:</strong> The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 2. Additionally, for each square you move on your turn before you use a weapon ability that deals rolled damage using your unarmed strikes, this extra damage increases by 1 (to a maximum of 4).</p><p><strong>9th Level:</strong> The extra lightning damage granted by the treads increases to 3, and your movement can increase that extra damage to a maximum of 6. Additionally, you can use a maneuver to perform a flying lightning kick on one adjacent creature. That target is pushed up to 5 squares, and you can move to any square adjacent to the target after the push.</p>",
