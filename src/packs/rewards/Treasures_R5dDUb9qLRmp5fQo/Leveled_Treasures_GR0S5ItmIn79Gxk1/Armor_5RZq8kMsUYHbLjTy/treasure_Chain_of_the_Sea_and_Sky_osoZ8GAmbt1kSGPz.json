      "value": "<p><em>This set of heavy chain mail is created to allow free movement in extreme environments without sacrificing protection.</em></p><p><strong>1st Level:</strong> While you wear this armor, you gain a +6 bonus to Stamina, you can automatically swim at full speed while moving, and you can breathe underwater for up to 1 hour. Returning to the surface to breathe air again for any length of time reset’s the armor’s water-breathing benefit.</p><p><strong>5th Level:</strong> The armor’s bonus to Stamina increases to +12, and you have cold immunity 5. Additionally, whenever you fall, you can extend your arms (no action required) to unfurl a thick membrane between your arms and your body, slowing your fall and allowing you to glide. While gliding this way, you move downward at 1 square per round, and you can glide up to 6 squares horizontally as a free maneuver once during each of your turns.</p><p><strong>9th Level:</strong> The armor’s bonus to Stamina increases to +21, and you have cold immunity 10. Additionally, whenever your feet are not touching the ground (including floating in water or being in midair), you gain an edge on ability rolls, and any ability takes a bane when targeting you.</p>",
