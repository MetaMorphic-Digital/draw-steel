      "value": "<p><em>This ancient wooden tablet is inscribed with eldritch runes and stained with dark blood.</em></p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> The Gravekeeper’s Lantern can temporarily trap a nonhostile spirit of the dead—either an incorporeal undead or the wandering spirit of a creature who died within the last 30 days—allowing you to interrogate them. Trapping a spirit requires you to be within 10 squares of them and succeed on a hard Intuition test as a main action. Once a spirit is trapped, you make a Presence test to coax them into answering your questions:</p><dl class=\"power-roll-display\"><dt class=\"tier1\"><p>!</p></dt><dd><p>You can ask two questions of the spirit, one of which they must answer fully and honestly.</p></dd><dt class=\"tier2\"><p>@</p></dt><dd><p>You can ask three questions, two of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.</p></dd><dt class=\"tier3\"><p>#</p></dt><dd><p>You can ask five questions, all of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.</p></dd></dl><p>A trapped spirit remains in the lantern for 10 minutes. They remember being trapped by you, and might become hostile thereafter.</p>",
