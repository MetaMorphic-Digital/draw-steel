      "value": "<p>Keywords: Hands</p><p><em>These finely stitched gloves appear to flicker in and out of reality when first handled.</em></p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> When you use a move action while wearing these gloves, you can place one hand upon a mundane object as part of that move action. If the object is 1 square thick or less and has open space on the other side (for example, a door or wall), you pull your body through it as though the object wasn't there.</p><p>If the object is too thick or has no open space on the other side, your hand becomes stuck inside the object. Removing your hand takes a successful hard Might test made as a main action.</p>",
