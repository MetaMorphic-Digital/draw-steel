That creature must answer the next three questions they are asked truthfully and fully. If twisted 90 degrees counterclockwise instead, the creature forgets the last 30 minutes they experienced. A creature affected by the key can’t be affected again by any Key of Inquiry for 1 year. If the key is ever destroyed, all the memories it has erased are restored. Memories erased by the key can’t be restored in any other way.</p>",
