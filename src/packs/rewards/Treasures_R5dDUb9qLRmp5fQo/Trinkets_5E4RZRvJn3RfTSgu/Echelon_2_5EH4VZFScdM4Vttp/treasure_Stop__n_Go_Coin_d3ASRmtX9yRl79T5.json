Roll a [[/roll 1d3]] to determine the coin’s effect, depending on which face shows when it lands: </p><p><strong>1—Red:</strong> The area within 2 squares of you is difficult terrain for enemies until the end of your next turn. </p><p><strong>2—Green:</strong> You and each ally who starts their turn within 2 squares of you gains a +1 bonus to speed until the end of your next turn. </p><p><strong>3—Spinning Coin:</strong> Both the red and green effects occur while the coin continuously spins. </p><p>The coin must be picked up before it can be used again. If any creature picks up the coin, its effects immediately end.</p>",
