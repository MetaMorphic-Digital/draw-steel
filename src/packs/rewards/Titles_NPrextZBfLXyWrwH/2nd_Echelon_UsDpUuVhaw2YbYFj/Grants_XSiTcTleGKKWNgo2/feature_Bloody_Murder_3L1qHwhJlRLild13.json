The damage you take from this title can’t be reduced in any way. You can use this benefit only once per ability. If the creature is reduced to 0 Stamina by this corruption damage, the creature explodes in a shower of blood and you [[/heal @level]]{regain} the Stamina you lost. You can’t use this benefit on creatures without blood, such as constructs, elementals, or undead.</p>",
