Once per encounter, you can activate a boffin property as a maneuver.</p><p></p><p><strong>Boffin Properties</strong></p><p>Taking the Boffin benefit lets you use the following boffin properties as a maneuver:</p><ul><li><p>Make a test that uses the Disguise skill. You gain an edge on the test.</p></li><li><p>One mundane lock you touch is unlocked.</p></li><li><p>Choose a square within 10 squares, even if you don’t have line of effect to it. You can observe the area around that square as if you were in it.</p></li><li><p>You throw the boffin up to 10 squares, where it explodes in a 5 cube. Each creature in the area takes fire damage equal to 2d10 + your level. The boffin is permanently destroyed but can be replaced by your spymaster … though they don’t like doing so too often.</p></li></ul>",
