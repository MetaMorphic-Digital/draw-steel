The Director chooses the type of person who would value this secretâ€”usually a member of a particular faction, such as a Higaran noble, or a type of person, such as a fence of stolen goods. When engaged in a negotiation with this type of person, you can offer this secret. If they accept, their interest increases by 3 (to a maximum of 5). You can share this secret only once.</p>",
