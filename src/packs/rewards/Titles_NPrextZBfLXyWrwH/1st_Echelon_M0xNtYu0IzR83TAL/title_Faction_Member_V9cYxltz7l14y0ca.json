When engaged in a negotiation with any member of your faction, their patience increases by 2 (to a maximum of 5).</p><p>Additionally, the Director assigns you one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the faction in question. The Director can also create a custom benefit for a type of faction not noted here. You can use this benefit only in a settlement where your faction has a presence, and once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you complete a task for your faction.</p><ul><li><p><em>Academic Faction:</em> @Embed[Compendium.draw-steel.rewards.Item.ZOxPbuoH06MD99Rt inline]</p></li><li><p><em>Guild Faction:</em> @Embed[Compendium.draw-steel.rewards.Item.nQcHSefR0sy9VMiY inline]</p></li><li><p><em>Martial Faction:</em> @Embed[Compendium.draw-steel.rewards.Item.Zt5Z8sQzzi78MrDc inline]</p></li><li><p><em>Spy Faction:</em> @Embed[Compendium.draw-steel.rewards.Item.0TxCvtOlH7hFnfjo inline]</p></li></ul><p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this title multiple times, once for each faction.
