The Director tells you whether the master or the materials they’ve left behind are able to teach you what you want to learn.</p><h4>Improve Control</h4><p>You learn to use one of your heroic abilities more efficiently, reducing its baseline Heroic Resource cost by 1 (to a minimum of 1). You can gain this benefit only once for any ability.</p>",
