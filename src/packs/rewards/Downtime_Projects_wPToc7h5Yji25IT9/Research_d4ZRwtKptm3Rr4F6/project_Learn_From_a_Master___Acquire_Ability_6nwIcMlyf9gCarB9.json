The Director tells you whether the master or the materials they’ve left behind are able to teach you what you want to learn.</p><h4>Acquire Ability</h4><p>You gain one signature ability of your choice from the master’s class (gaining a second signature ability if the master is of the same class as you). If the master is a tactician, you can gain the Strike Now ability instead. You can’t gain this benefit again for the same class.</p>",
