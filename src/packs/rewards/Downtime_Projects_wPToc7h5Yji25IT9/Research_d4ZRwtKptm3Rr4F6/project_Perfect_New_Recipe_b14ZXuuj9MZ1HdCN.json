You gain a +3 bonus to the project roll if the recipe is one from your culture.</p><p>When you complete the project, you can make five servings of food from the recipe as a respite activity whenever you have access to the ingredients. You and other creatures taking a respite with you can eat a serving of the food and gain its benefits (see below).</p><p>A creature who eats a serving of food from a particular type of recipe gains one of the following benefits, which lasts until the creature takes another respite.</p><p><strong>Comforting:</strong> When the creature fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead. This benefit then ends.</p><p><strong>Hearty:</strong> The creature increases their Recoveries by 1 at the end of the respite in which the food is consumed.</p><p><strong>Supernatural Power:</strong> The creature temporarily increases one of their characteristic scores by 1 (to a maximum of 6).</p><p>A creature can benefit from the food of only one recipe at a time, and can’t benefit from more than one serving of a recipe at a time.</p><h4>Recipes</h4><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Type of Recipe</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Item Prerequisite</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Modern</p></td><td><p>Common ingredients (flour, carrots, beef, and so forth)</p></td><td><p>Hearty</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Vintage or home</p></td><td><p>Key ingredients (starfruit, kindleseeds, oarfish, and so forth)</p></td><td><p>Comforting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ancient or lost</p></td><td><p>Rare or extinct ingredients (honeylilies, steel apples, and so forth)</p></td><td><p>Supernatural power</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",
