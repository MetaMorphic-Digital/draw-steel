The Director tells you whether the master or the materials they’ve left behind are able to teach you what you want to learn.</p><h4>Hone Ability</h4><p>You sharpen the effectiveness of one of your abilities of your choice. Choose between adding a +1/+1/+1 damage bonus to the ability, or improving the distance of a ranged ability by 2. An ability can be honed only once this way.</p>",
