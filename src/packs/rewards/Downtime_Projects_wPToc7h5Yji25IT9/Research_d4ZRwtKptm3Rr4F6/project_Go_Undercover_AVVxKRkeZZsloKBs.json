      "value": "<p>Going undercover to spy on a group of people is a cheap and easy way to find information you’re looking for. Choose an organization when you undertake this activity. Completing this project grants you access to maps, knowledge about an organization’s operations, or some other piece of knowledge that would be considered common or obscure (see the Discover Lore project). </p><p>At the Director’s discretion, you must have a disguise, a signet ring, a special tattoo, or some other indication that you belong to the organization in order to start this project. Additionally, the Director can decide that the knowledge you seek can’t be gained through this project, but must be sought out by infiltrating the organization as part of an adventure. </p><h4>Complications </h4><p>This project has its own special complications. The first time you complete this project for an organization, you have a 25 percent chance of being caught. Each time you complete this project again with the same organization, the chance of being caught increases by 25 percent and the project goal increases by 30. If you are caught while going undercover, members of the organization pursue you ruthlessly as the Director determines. </p><p>Additionally, while you work to complete this project, you might be called upon by the organization to complete a task you might not want to do. Failure to complete the task leads to you being caught. You can avoid the task by fleeing the organization, but this prevents you from completing the project and makes it impossible for you to undertake this project again with the same organization.</p>",
