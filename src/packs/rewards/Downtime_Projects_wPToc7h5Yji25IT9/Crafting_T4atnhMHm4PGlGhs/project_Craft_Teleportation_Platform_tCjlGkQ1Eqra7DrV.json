      "value": "<p>When you complete this project, you end up with a 3-square-by-3- square teleportation platform activated by a supernatural password. The platform is permanently affixed to the ground in the location where you create it. Any creature with the password can use the teleportation platform to instantly teleport any creatures or objects on the platform to a location they know, including another teleportation platform whose supernatural password they know. You and any creature you designate upon completion of the activity can change the password as a respite activity.</p><p>Each time the teleportation platform is used, the chance of it malfunctioning and teleporting creatures or objects on it to a random platform increases by 1 percent (to a maximum of 50 percent). You can restore the platform back to its original condition and reset this chance of malfunction as a respite activity.</p>",
