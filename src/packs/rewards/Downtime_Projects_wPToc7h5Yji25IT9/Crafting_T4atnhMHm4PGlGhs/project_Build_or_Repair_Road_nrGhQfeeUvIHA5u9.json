      "value": "<p>When you start this project, you hire a crew of masons, engineers, and guards who start work at the location where the project begins and build or repair the road for you. You can make a project roll whenever you are overseeing the project, whether you do so in person or remotely through the use of magic or psionics.</p><p>The number of project points required to complete work on the road equals 10 × the road’s length in miles. The goal is cut in half if you are repairing an existing road, or if someone else starts work on a second road project that connects to your project.</p><p>When you complete the project, you earn Renown among people in the area where the road is built, depending on the length of the road.</p><p>Time spent traveling between locations on the road is cut in half. Access to resources and knowledge is improved in locations along the road, giving you and your allies an edge on project rolls to discover lore while you are in those areas.</p><h4>Build or Repair Road Renown</h4><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Length</strong></th><th><strong>Renown Earned</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>50 miles or less</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>51–100 miles</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>More than 100 miles</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h4>Build or Repair Roads Events</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.draw-steel.tables.RollTable.tXtAQLmmJP1vHK6R]</p><p></p>",
