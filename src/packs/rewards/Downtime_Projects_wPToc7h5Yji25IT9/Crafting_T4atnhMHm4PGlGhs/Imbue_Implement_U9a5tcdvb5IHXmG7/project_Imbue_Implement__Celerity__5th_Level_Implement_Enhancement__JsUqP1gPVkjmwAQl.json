      "value": "<h4>Imbue treasure</h4><p>You can create leveled treasures by imbuing items with magic or psionic power. You must have a mundane version of the item you plan to imbue, such as a sword or shield, when you start this project.</p><p>You can imbue any item three times. The first time you imbue it, you pick a 1st-level enhancement. The second time you imbue it, you pick a 5th-level enhancement. The third time you imbue it, you pick a 9th-level enhancement. A hero using armor or a weapon can’t benefit from an enhancement unless they are using a kit that includes the armor or weapon type, and their level matches the enhancement’s level.</p><p>If an enhancement has a Roman numeral greater than I after it, such as the Phasing III enhancement, that enhancement can’t be applied unless the item has all previous versions of the enhancement. This means you can’t imbue armor with the Phasing III enhancement unless it has the Phasing I and Phasing II enhancements first. The effects of numbered enhancements are cumulative unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Enhancements are broken out by item type (armor, implement, or weapon) and level. Each item type and level features a table showing the name, item prerequisite, and project source language of each enhancement. Imbued items take the Magic or Psionic keyword (your choice) and are part of any kit categories appropriate to the type of item (light armor, medium weapon, and so forth).</p><p>Imbuing treasure with supernatural power as a downtime project typically means you undertake that project to make use of the treasure yourself. As such, all the features of imbuing refer to “you” as the user of the item. However, imbued items can be created for other creatures, or created by other creatures and found as treasure.</p><h4>Imbue Implement</h4><p>Implements are jewelry, spectacles, orbs, staffs, tomes, wands, weapons, and other objects used by those who channel magic and psionic power to focus that power. You decide what object to imbue when you create an implement treasure, but it must be an object you can carry or wear. You must have a mundane version of the item you plan to imbue when you start this project.</p><p>An implement imbued with an enhancement grants you special benefits while it is wielded. Additionally, when an implement receives its 1st-level enhancement, it grants your magic or psionic abilities that deal rolled damage a +1 damage bonus. A 5th-level enhancement increases the bonus to +2, and a 9th-level enhancement increases it to +3. Censors, conduits, elementalists, nulls, talents, and troubadours benefit from using implements more than the other classes in this book.</p><p><strong>Celerity:</strong> Immediately after using a magic or psionic ability that requires a main action, you can shift up to 3 squares, or you can use the Escape Grab maneuver as a free maneuver (see Maneuvers in Chapter 10: Combat).</p>",
