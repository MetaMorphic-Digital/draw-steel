Within Draw Steel, an Item is any discrete piece of rules content; it not only includes equipment, but abilities, ancestries, and even projects.

The Foundry [Knowledge Base](https://foundryvtt.com/article/items/) has more info on the basics of combat encounters; this page is focused on system-specific information.

## General Info

Abilities that are both melee and ranged have an additional context option to switch their display between ranged and melee; this is relevant if a character has kit or other bonuses that only apply to one or the other modes.

The Draw Steel system automatically applies the bonuses from kits.
