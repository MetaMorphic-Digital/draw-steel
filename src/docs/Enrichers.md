"Enrichers" refer to specialized text syntax that can be used in any rich text editor (such as an actor description, journal entry, or chat message). Enriched content displays simply in the editor but can represent large and complex displays in the rendered text.

## Item Embeds

All items support the `@Embed[uuid]` syntax, which by default share the description of the item. For abilities, kits, and projects, their embeds feature additional information.
