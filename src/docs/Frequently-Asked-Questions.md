# Frequently Asked Questions

### I can't find [game feature] anywhere. Is it implemented yet, are there plans for it?

Have a look in the System Wiki if you can find what you are looking for there. Some things are not obvious at first glance, but should be explained in the Wiki

But chances are, the feature you are looking for has not been implemented yet. Feel free to ask about it on the [Foundry discord server](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1390065189453435041) or the [MDCDM discord server](https://discord.com/channels/332362513368875008/1342298358664138805).

The [issues list](https://github.com/MetaMorphic-Digital/draw-steel/issues) contains all current feature requests, please check there first to see if a request has already been made; feel free to add a comment to existing tickets, as these can help decide prioritization. If you cannot find an existing ticket, please open a [feature request ticket](https://github.com/MetaMorphic-Digital/draw-steel/issues/new/choose) so it can be considered.

### If I would want to get a certain module compatibility working with the Draw Steel system, what do I need to do about that?

- We're happy to provide guidance to users integrating modules for personal configuration, submitting pull requests to modules, or creating compatibility modules
- We're willing to take pull requests for module compatibility on a limited basis; the system already provides integration for **Dice so Nice** natively
