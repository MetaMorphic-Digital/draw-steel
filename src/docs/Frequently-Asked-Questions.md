## Is Draw Steel available in other languages?

The system fully implements Foundry's i18n framework, so non-English languages can be provided as modules. The [Babele](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/babele) module is a popular option for translating compendium content.

## Modules

### Are there any recommended modules?

There are no "recommended" modules for use with Draw Steel. The system is designed to be fully supported and playable by itself.

### How can I integrate a module with Draw Steel?

Reach out via Discord where you can be provided with guidance on integrating modules for personal configuration, adding compatibility directly to modules, or creating compatibility modules. Pull requests to Draw Steel directly for the purpose of module compatibility will only be accepted on a limited basis; the system currently only provides native integration for **Dice so Nice**.
