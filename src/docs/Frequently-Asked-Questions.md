# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I play Draw Steel in non-English languages

The system fully implements Foundry's i18n framework, so non-English languages can be provided as modules. The [Babele](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/babele) module is a popular option for translating compendium content.

## Modules

### Are there any recommended modules?

There are no "recommended" modules for use with Draw Steel. The system is designed to be fully supported and playable by itself.

### How can I integrate a module with Draw Steel?

Reach out via Discord â€” We're happy to provide guidance to users and developers on integrating modules for personal configuration, adding compatibility directly to modules, or creating compatibility modules. Pull requests to Draw Steel directly will only be accepted on an limited basis; the system currently only provides native integration for **Dice so Nice**.
